Croatian student Dusko Kostic has been awarded the Student Peace Prize 2011 for his efforts to improve the civil rights of the Roma through education. Kostic is himself of Roma origin, and is the first European student to receive the prize. "The achievements of Kosti 's work are impressive", says Eirik Vikum, director of the Student Peace Prize Secretariat. In a Roma population that is troubled by high levels of school dropouts, Kostic's grassroots effort shift the trend through home visits and close follow-up of both children and parents. 94 percent of the school children taking part in his projects complete primary education, and several have started higher education. - Kostic's work is an inspiration to people from minority groups in all of Europe, also in Norway, says Eirik Vikum. "Kostic is an everyday hero in his local environment. He shows that the struggle for the civil rights of the Roma is not only about fighting racism and discrimination, but also about encouraging role models and spokespersons from within", says Vikum. Dusko Kostic has been elected to the City Council of his hometown Beli Manastir, which lies on the border between Croatia, Serbia and Hungary. There he represents the local Roma population and initiates projects for social change. Through his political work, Kostic strongly contradicts stereotypes. "This award says two things. It is a protest against a modern Europe that is still failing to treat the Roma with dignity. At the same time it says that change for the Roma must also come from within", says Eirik Vikum. The Roma are a widely discussed ethnic minority that has been subjected to persecution and discrimination for centuries. The Roma continue to be Europe's most vulnerable minority, and recent waves of expulsions in France and Italy indicate that their conditions in Europe are worsening. In March 2010 Croatia was sentenced by the European Court of Human Rights for segregation of Roma children in schools.
