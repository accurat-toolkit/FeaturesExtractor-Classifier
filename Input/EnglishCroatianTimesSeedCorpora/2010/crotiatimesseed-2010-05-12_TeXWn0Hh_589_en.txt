In the run-up to its annual meeting in Zagreb this week, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has today released its new Country Strategy for Croatia. In response to calls for the bank to assure the public that its loans to financial intermediaries (private banks) are not environmentally harmful, the EBRD said: "The Bank does not require reporting on sectors financed and other details (including the identity of beneficiaries) of loans to SMEs through intermediaries, as burdensome reporting of individual loans would discourage the intermediaries from engaging in small business finance." Given the increased emphasis that the EBRD is now placing on financial intermediaries lending - now thought to be close to 40 percent of the bank's annual lending - Bankwatch is calling for a much-needed opening up of the EBRD's FI lending, to not only ascertain for the public if the bank's billions via FIs are serving the public and the environment, but also to know exactly which SMEs are benefiting at all. Petr Hlobil,  Bankwatch's International Affairs Coordinator, said: "It's incredible that the EBRD is still willing to throw billions at the private banking system and not demand some basic transparency that would enable the public, and even the bank's shareholders, to determine who is being served by these mega loans. "The SME sector in central and eastern Europe is crying out for support, jobs are being cut, yet the EBRD is sticking to its guns and off-loading billions of taxpayers money to what is little more than a big black hole. "Let's get over this talk about a burden on the banks. How about they start reporting what they're actually doing with public money in central and eastern Europe? As a development bank, it's the least we would expect the EBRD to insist on finally."
