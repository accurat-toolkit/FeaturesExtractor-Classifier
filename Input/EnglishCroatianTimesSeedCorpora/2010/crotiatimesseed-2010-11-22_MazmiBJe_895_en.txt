An Austrian businessman had to help out Croatian tennis legend Goran Ivanisevic and his wife with cash, it has been revealed. Edwin Weindorfer, head organiser of the ATP Challenger tournament Salzburg which ended yesterday (Sun), told the Salzburger Nachrichten newspaper today: "They forgot their money and credit cards in their hotel rooms, so I had to met them during their shopping spree in the city centre to help out with a considerable amount in cash." Ivanisevic, who won 22 career titles including Wimbledon in 2001 before retiring six years ago, beat Austrian ace Thomas Muster in a special "Match of the Legends" 6-4, 7-5 yesterday. Asked by the Salzburger Nachrichten whether he could imagine following Muster's example to dare a comeback, Ivanisevic said: "Two to three hours of daily training - that's too much for me." When being informed that the 43-year-old Austrian, who returned earlier this year after having stopped playing on the ATP tour in 1999, works twice as much per day, the Croat just said: "Well, that's typically Thomas." Ivanisevic said ahead of his match against the 1995 French Open champ: "Thomas was one of the best in the world. I was always impressed by his fighting spirit. (.) I admire him." Tatjana Ivanisevic said about her 43-year-old husband's performance: "He obviously still loves to play. I haven't seen him serving better than today in a long time", Austrian Times has reported. She proudly added: "Goran didn't gain more than two to three kilos since quitting professional tennis." The tournament's main competition was won by Conor Niland. The Irishman beat Pole Jerzy Janowicz in three sets (7-6, 6-7, 6-3). Weindorfer said he could organise a "Legends Tournament" after the exhibition match between Ivanisevic and Muster attracted more fans than most of the event's regular fixtures. "Setting up such an event would certainly be a challenge," the ATP Salzburg Indoors boss told the Salzburger Nachrichten.
