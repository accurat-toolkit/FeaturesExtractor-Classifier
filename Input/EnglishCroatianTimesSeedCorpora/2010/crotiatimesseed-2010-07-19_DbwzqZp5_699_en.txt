Bulgarian archaeologists have unveiled these images of the "first European man" showing the 8,000-year-old skeleton of a man they have named Chris. The body that was found near the village of Ohoden in Bulgaria has been taken to the Regional History Museum in Vratsa and has been hailed by local media as the discovery of the "first European man". Chris was discovered by archaeologist Georgi Ganetsovski, who specializes in palaeolithic settlements, who said Chris had been a 35-year-old man with a height of 165cm when he died. This is the fourth 8,000-year-old skeleton found in the Valoga region near Ohoden, but all the others had been women. This was the first one belonging to a man. "We are uncovering a so far unknown prehistoric culture in Northwest Bulgaria which corresponds to the settlements in today's Serbia along the Morava River. These were a civilised people that moved in to colonise Europe following the Danube River. "One of the aims of our studies is to test the theory about the so called "Danube Road" of the spreading of the first settlements with economic production," archaeologist Ganetsovski added. He has studied the site near Ohoden since 2004 when he discovered the skeleton of a woman that was named Todorka, and which can be seen in the museum in Vratsa. The latest skeleton has been given the Bulgarian name Hristo - meaning Chris. It was transferred to the museum where DNA and other tests to be carried out. "We already have found four individuals here, and we will have to sacrifice one tooth from each of them for the DNA tests. I do feel concerned because by excavating these graves, I am disturbing their resting in peace," Ganetsovski admitted.
