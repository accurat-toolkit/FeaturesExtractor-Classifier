Up to 60 horses have been quarantined following an outbreak of leptospirosis in Zagreb's hippodrome just days before 30,000 people are expected to attend a Metallica concert to be held there on Sunday. The illness is usually spread from rats to other animals but when transferred to humans - through contact with contaminated water by broken skin or through lining of the eye - it can cause miscarriages, kidney inflammation and possibly death. The bacteria dies in the digestive track. Professor Antun Beus, the director of the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Zagreb added that the disease has become more acute with several people dying last year. The veterinary inspector has ordered 60 of the 175 Hippodrome's horse quarantined, and has urged disinfection and sanitation of the sewerage and drainage system, sanitation of a damaged floor and drying out of the affected area. The disease is treated with antibiotics both in humans and in animals, and the horses are expected to receive the first dose on Monday, after the concert. However, Zagreb's Department of Public Health has reassured worried fans that the danger to humans is negligible. The Metallica concert organisers did not seem concerned about the outbreak. "We should have been informed, but obviously they did not think it was necessary because they believe that there is no danger. The horses will not come into contact with the audience, and during the last 10 days they did not even walk around the area where the audience will be," said Vladimir Ivankovic, director of Lupa Promotions that organized the concert. But horse riders are more worried because it is uncertain whether horses will recover to participate in this year's races, Croatian daily Vecernji List reports.
