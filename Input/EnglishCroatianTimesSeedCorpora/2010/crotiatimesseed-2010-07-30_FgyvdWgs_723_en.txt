Women will retire at the same age as men by 2020 and early retirement will be penalised with lower pensions, according to government proposals for retirement law amendments sent to parliament yesterday (Thu). The retirement age for women would increase from the current 60 to 65 years. The increase would be gradual, rising by six months over the next 10 years. While the changes coincide with a decision reached by the Constitutional Court in 2007, they are also influenced by negative demographic trends, the government said. "The pension system the way it is today is unsustainable and we must make such unpopular decisions," Economy Minister Djuro Popijac said. The latest changes also penalise early retirement, a measure that international financial institutions have been requesting from Croatia. Of Croatia's 1.19 million, only 11.6 per cent retired after working for 40 years, while 23.8 per cent stop after 35 years. For every month of early retirement the pension would be decreased by 0.34 per cent, which would be a little below 4.08 per cent on a yearly basis or 20.4 per cent over a period of five years. Should a person decide to retire later than the official age, their pension would increase the same percentage. There are also certain changes to the unemployment system. According to the new proposals, the compensation for the first three months of unemployment would be 70 per cent of the basic salary, followed by 35 per cent for the next period. At the same time, the government wants to encourage education and training for the unemployed, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes.
