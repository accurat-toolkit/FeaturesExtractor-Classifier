A Croatian woman who beat 250 men to win last year's biggest Croatian poker tournament has singed a sponsoring agreement making her the first woman in Croatia to enter professional poker. Hana Soljan - a student from Zagreb - signed the agreement with Unibet, European online poker operator and tournament organiser, and her first tournament with her new sponsorship is scheduled for August 5 in Prague. She is joined by another female Zeljka Penciger, also a member of the Ladies team that the women organised together with another poker player, Sonja Kovac. The team is currently searching for its "fourth queen," they joke. The poker ladies are still fighting prejudices. In the last tournament in Porec, they were ridiculed by some of their male competitors. "At the beginning they were saying, 'look at the girls, how will they play with us?' and in the end, all three of us ended up in the finals," Soljan said. Woman Poker Playing Magazine has nominated them for the annual Poker Maven Award for best marketing campaign to promote women in poker. There is no doubt that Hana, together with the ladies' team, has popularized women's poker in Croatia. Every Thursday, (except during summer) there are women poker nights organised by the Croatian lottery. After the summer vacation, Hana Soljan will return to domestic tournaments when the new league and new TV programme begins. Modelled after the popular American show in which viewers can follow games, the series will profile Croatia's best poker players and their games. "We made a pilot show and it looks great, but we are still negotiating as to which TV station will buy it," Soljan told the Croatian daily Jutarnji List.
