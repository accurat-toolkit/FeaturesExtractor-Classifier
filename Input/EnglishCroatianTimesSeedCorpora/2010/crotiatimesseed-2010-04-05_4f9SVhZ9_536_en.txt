Croatia is set to demand compensation from an Austrian pensioner who faked his own suicide in the Adriatic last September to avoid charges that he abused his daughter. Sixty-eight-year-old Vienna man Helmut Breit thought to have committed suicide in Croatia was found alive and well at a monastery in Upper Austria a month ago. The man jumped off a ferry in Croatian waters in front of dozens of witnesses in an apparent suicide. The Croatian police concluded he had committed suicide. "The Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure will together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs start the process of demanding the damage money for the search for the Austrian," Marina Haluzan, spokeswoman of the Croatian Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure said. She added the exact amount couldn't be confirmed yet, but said the state owned agency that led the search for the body had prepared a list of actions it took in trying to find the Austrian after he jumped from the Jazine ferry from Preko to Zadar on 25 September last year. The man had most probably arranged for a motorboat to pick him up and fled to the monastery last October. A Pupping monastery official said: "He said he was interested in faith and wanted to join us. He worked as a gardener. "We did not ask him where he came from. Our doors are open for everyone - for friend and foe. But we never thought he had such a background. "He cycled to the shops in the neighbouring town everyday, but most of the time just bought cigarettes," he added. Police found out about the man's background and his attempt to escape justice during a random traffic check.
