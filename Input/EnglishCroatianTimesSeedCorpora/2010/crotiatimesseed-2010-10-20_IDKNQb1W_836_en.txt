An unemployed Polish actor used his acting skills to pretend to be a British aristocrat and blag private jets, hotel suites and tens of thousands of pounds worth of designer goods from boutiques all over Europe. Bartek Kaminski, 21, who set up a fake company in the United Kingdom and hired a string of beautiful secretaries to accompany him on his visits, was so good at his role that he even managed to get his contacts to provide him with an expense account that he used to buy designer goods. Kaminski told police he was inspired by "Catch Me If You Can", the movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio about the life of conman Frank Abagnale Jr. Forging powerful contacts among Europe's business elite, Kaminski lived the high life jetting between luxury hotels in London, Paris, Warsaw, and Amsterdam, with beautiful assistants in tow - and he did not have a penny. Kaminski, who used charm and acting skills to flatter and impress, was given a special credit card by one wealthy businessman allowing him to run up a bill of hundreds of thousands shopping in Paris, dining at the most expensive restaurants, living it up in exclusive nightclubs and later enjoying Amsterdam's red light district. In London, he visited the best restaurants and faked business documents and faxes under the name of a bogus company to give credibility to his fantasy life and as the owner of a high class tour operator for millionaires. Kaminski, however, knew he could not get away with it for ever, and so after six months he faked a heart attack, and then sneaked out of the hospital to disappear. He was caught after suspicious police in the Polish city of Warsaw stopped him on a bus in a hospital gown - and an investigation into why he had run away unravelled his web of lies. "This is a very intelligent man. Otherwise he couldn't have got away with it for so long," a judge told Polish daily Super Express. Kaminski now faces eight years in jail.
