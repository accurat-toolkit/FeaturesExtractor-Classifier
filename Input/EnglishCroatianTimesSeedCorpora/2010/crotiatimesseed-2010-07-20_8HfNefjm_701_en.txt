President Ivo Josipovic has said national minorities are the wealth of and link between Croatia and Serbia. In his speech Sunday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the foundation of the Democratic League of Croats in Voivodina, DSHV (north Serbia), Josipovic told the 3,000 gathered members: "You are the strongest political and civilizing force of this community and that is why you have a very important role in its preservation." He added that in Serbian President Boris Tadic he had found both "a partner and a friend" on a mutual quest for "politics of peace, cooperation and cohabitation." Tadic also addressed the crowd, saying that the community will find in him a partner in nurturing identities and uniqueness of Croatian people in Serbia and Voivodina. Petar Kuntic, the president of DHSV said the party expects the support of the Serbian state in its pursuit of minority rights. From their home country Croatia they requested more understanding and attention, the Croatian portal Business writes. After the ceremony President Josipovic told reporters that the issue of direct mandates for the representatives of the Croatian minority in the National Assembly of Serbia - which the DHSV has been demanding for years - is an internal question. "I am certain that Serbia, as a democratic country, will find a way to have the Croatian minority be represented in the Serbian Assembly," Josipovic said. He added that he welcomes the elimination of the visa regime for citizens of Serbia, which would allow them to enter Croatia only with their ID cards. "I encourage the Croatian government to accept that - this is good for tourism and the development of good neighbourly relations," Josipovic said.
