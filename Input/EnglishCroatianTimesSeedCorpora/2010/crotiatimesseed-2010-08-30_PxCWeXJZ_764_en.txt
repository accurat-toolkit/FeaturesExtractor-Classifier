Former model Heather Mills moved closer to winning a place in the 2014 Paralympics after she out shot the best female marksmen in an army shooting contest. Austrian regional newspaper the Kleine Zeitung reports today (Mon) that the ex-wife of Beatles legend Paul McCartney turned up as a surprise entrant at the shooting competition of the Austrian army's East Tyrol division in Lavant - and came first in the ladies event, leaving dozens of female soldiers behind her. Mills - who wears a prosthesis after losing part of her left leg in a traffic accident in 1993 - told the newspaper she was training for the 2014 Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, by spending time in Austria. "I'm training on the M lltaler Glacier," she said, while her coach Alexander K ll said: "She's incredibly ambitious. It's outstanding what she achieves wearing a prosthesis." Asked why she picked the province of Carinthia to prepare for the Paralympics, Mills said: "I came here to go skiing many years ago - before I was wearing a prosthesis. When I felt like skiing recently, Carinthia came into my mind immediately." Mills - who also campaigns for the animal rights organisation PETA - said she was now dividing her time between her main residence near London and Carinthia. "I enjoy everything here - especially the friendliness of the people," she said. Reports have it that locals have given her the nickname "Hedwig" - an old-fashioned German female first name - because its easier to say than Heather. Another local newspaper, the K rntner Tageszeitung, revealed earlier this month that the 42-year-old bought a special prosthesis she can use to go skiing at an orthopaedic store in Klagenfurt.
