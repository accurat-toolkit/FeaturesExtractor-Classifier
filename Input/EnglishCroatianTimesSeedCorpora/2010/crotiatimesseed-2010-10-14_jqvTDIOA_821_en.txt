A Jewish family living in Israel has accused the government of refusing to return citizenship just so that they do not have to give back a textile factory in the northern Croatian town of Cakovec that was confiscated by force in 1948. Speaking to the Croatian Times Alon Hirschsohn said that his father Franjo Efraim Hirschsohn is demanding the return of the Cateks factory that had been seized like many other firms in former Yugoslavia by communist authorities that wanted to nationalise all private property. Conservative estimates say that the value of the factory and assets claimed by the family would be worth several million euros. He said: "My family was expelled by force in 1948. The government at that time took all their property and if they had opposed them, they would have died. "My father fled Croatia with his family on Dec 7, 1948, when he was one year old. We have all the references that prove this factory and its assets belong to us. But the government is refusing to consider it because we do not have citizenship. "However they have so far rejected every attempt we have made to regain citizenship so we can pursue this matter. The only reason they have to reject us is because they do not want to deal with the matter but my father was born in Croatia - he has a right to citizenship." Officials at the Cateks company in Cakovec confirmed they know about "demands from the Neuman family", however they say the matter needs to be taken up with the government. "The Croatian Privatisation Fund is the address to contact", Djurdja Mesaric of Cateks told the Croatian Times. On the Cateks web site it even explains that the factory was founded by Alon Hirschsohn's great-grandfather.
