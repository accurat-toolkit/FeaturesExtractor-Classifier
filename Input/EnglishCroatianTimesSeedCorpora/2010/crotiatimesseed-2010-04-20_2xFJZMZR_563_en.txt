The Croatian American Charitable Foundation (CACF) announced today that Davor Suker will be holding a "Mini Clinic for Charity". The clinic will be for children between the ages of 9-14 and all proceeds will benefit the CACF and its ongoing battle to remove unexploded mines in Croatia left over from the 1990's war. The Davor Suker Soccer Academy ( www.sukeracademy.com ) was established at the end of Mr. Suker's playing career with training camps in Zagreb, Croatia and other cities around the world. Over the past 4 years, Mr. Suker has held camps in the US (New York), Canada (Calgary & Toronto), Austria, Switzerland, Croatia and Bosnia & Hercegovina. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, Suker was selected as the Golden Player of Croatia by the Croatian Football Federation as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. In March 2004, he was named by Pel  as one of the 125 greatest living footballers and was the only Croatian player to be added to the list. After the 2002 World Cup, he retired from international football and went on to be an icon for many children around the world, but mostly in Croatia where he was seen as national hero. Suker won a total of 71 international caps during his professional career, 2 for Yugoslavia and 69 for Croatia, and scored a total of 46 international goals. With 69 international caps, he is currently only the third most-capped player in the Croatian national team, but his goalscoring record of 45 goals for the team will probably remain unbeaten for decades, since the nearest followers have all scored less than 30 goals. The Charity event scheduled for Saturday, May 15th 2010, will take place at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) campus in Old Westbury, Long Island from 10am-1pm.
