A significant rise in the use of marijuana, alcohol and tobacco has been registered amongst students of primary and secondary schools in Zagreb, a new research by Institute for Public Health "Dr. Andrija Stampar" shows. The research conducted on a sample of 2,500 students and financed by the City of Zagreb shows alarming trends.  Zagreb's youth light up their first cigarette at the age of 12, which means that they start smoking two years earlier than the previous research conducted in 2005 shows. According to the Institute, 14.2 per cent of eight graders smoke, which is 8.1 per cent more than in 2005. The first joint is usually smoked at 15 or half a year earlier than  previous research indicated. Doctor Mirjana Orban, the head of the investigation, said that the results mean that in just a few years, use of marijuana could "move into" primary schools. On average, 41.6 per cent of students consume alcohol, or two per cent more than in 2005. Last year, 150 youths under 16 have been admitted to Zagreb's hospital because of intoxication. Another fact is that both boys and girls use these substances equally. "That fact shows that smoking and intoxication has become the way of life and that young people consider opiates as necessary for having a good time," the doctor said. She added that most students had managed to purchase their own alcohol and cigarettes, despite the laws. Orban announced the beginning of educational initiatives aimed at teachers and parents for September, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reports. "But the results will not be satisfactory unless sellers don't start respecting the law," she added.
