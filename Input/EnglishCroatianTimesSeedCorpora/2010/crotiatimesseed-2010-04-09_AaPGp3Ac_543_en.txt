Austrian Bundesliga club LASK Linz is to ditch two of their goalkeepers, including Croat Silvije Cavlina, it emerged today (Fri). Former Austrian Under-21s national team keeper Michael Zaglmair said he had started looking for a new club, while club bosses announced Croat Silvije Cavlina has also been given the chance to leave after this season. Zaglmair, who failed to become the team's first choice keeper during the last five years with the club, revealed national and international clubs had shown interest in him, Austrian Times has reported. Cavlina meanwhile revealed he would prefer to stay on board. The Croat performed in 65 league matches for the team managed by Helmut Kraft after joining them from Croatian side HNK Sibenik in 2007. He was suspended for weeks from the senior squad in winter and barred from taking part in its training camp in Belek, Turkey. But he made clear today he was not looking back in anger. "I wouldn't have had a problem with staying at LASK. I've got friends here," the 32-year-old said. The team's third senior squad keeper is former Chelsea London player J rgen Macho who was Austria's first choice goalie at the Euro2008. LASK bosses are meanwhile also expected to allow Lithuanian defender Vidas Alunderis to leave in the upcoming transfer window - despite Austrian Under-21s national team defender Georg Margreitter's joining of league rivals Austria Vienna after this season. Kraft explained: "We want to reduce our 26-member squad to just 22 players." The Austrian Bundesliga continues tonight when seventh-placed SV Ried host second-placed Rapid. LASK, who are currently in eighth, clash with Magna Wiener Neustadt tomorrow. The Bundesliga table after 28 rounds: Red Bull Salzburg, 62 points Rapid Vienna, 56 Austria Vienna, 53 Sturm Graz, 48 Magna Wiener Neustadt, 36 Mattersburg, 33 SV Ried, 32 LASK Linz, 30 Kapfenberg, 25 Austria K rnten, 11
