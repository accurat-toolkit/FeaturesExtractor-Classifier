Sisak-Moslavina County in central Croatia will subsidise the cultivation of medicinal herbs in order to make the region's farmers more competitive. There is a large potential for cultivation of these plants in certain parts of the country where conventional agriculture has not developed. Sisak-Moslavina County is such a region, which has ensured 14,000 Euros of government money for new plantations. Zoran Vasic the head of the County's agricultural department said that the subsidies are meant to make the local producers more competitive. "Imported and refined camomile from Egypt is less expensive than the camomile here, so we decided to help the farmers growing medicinal herbs rise to their competitors." For every new hectare dedicated to medicinal plant production the County will give 5,000 kunas (688 Euros) plus 2,000 kunas (275 kunas) of subsidies. That could double the current surface. There is also a big interest on the part of the food industry in horseradish. No one in the region is currently producing it, so a part of the subsidies could go towards stimulating its cultivation. Last year Croatia imported 750 tons of medicinal herbs out of which many could (or already do) grow in Croatia. Although statistics do not register the exact species imported, the experts say that Croatia buys everything from stinging nettle that grows in the wild, to lemon balm, mint and lavender that thrives in Dalmatia and has proven successful in other areas as well. For companies that use these herbs it is often more cost effective to import than organise production within the country as this is, in addition to being expensive, also strictly regulated because of EU standards that forbid pesticide use. Croatia exported six million Euros worth of medicinal herbs last year.  Camomile formed 80 percent of those exports with Germany and Italy being Croatia's main buyers. The value of just the camomile exports was 5.3 million Euros.
