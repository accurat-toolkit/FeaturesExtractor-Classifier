Former EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler says he doubts David Cameron's hopes that Turkey will join the EU will ever happen. The politician who is a member of the Austrian People's Party (OeVP) said: "I still think that Turkey's accession is never going to happen as there are enough (EU) member countries ready to hold a referendum on the issue." Fischler - who acted as the Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries between 1995 and 2004 - added at least one of the possible referendums would bring a negative result that would scupper any deal that the EU and the Turkish government might reach. Fischler told Austrian daily Kurier he could imagine a "privileged partnership" between the EU and the country might work out. Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) Chancellor Angela Merkel as well as several other EU decision-makers back this option. But Fischer added: "No one knows what this (a 'privileged partnership') is supposed to be. Good economic relationships however are important." Fischler - who currently consults the Turkish government over how best to spend the around three million Euros the country will have received by 2013 - pointed out that labour unionists in EU member states feared an increase in Turkish workers on the EU job market if there was an accession, while national industries want to access the thriving Turkish market. "And others see an ideological problem (in a possible accession)," he added. British Prime Minister David Cameron is one of the most outspoken supporters of Turkish accession among EU leaders, while France and Germany oppose it.
