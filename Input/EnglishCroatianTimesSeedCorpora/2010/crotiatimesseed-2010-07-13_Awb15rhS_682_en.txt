The United Kingdom is the second most popular country for Romanian's looking for work abroad after Germany according to a new study published today (Tuesday) by the online jobs recruitment website Tjobs.ro. The site revealed that 51,000 Romanians had applied for a job in UK in the first six months of this year with 5,000 being accepted and signing contracts for jobs in the UK. Germany was only slightly more popular according to the website data which revealed there had been 52,880 applications for work there. In total they said 426,443 Romanians applied for a job abroad with 72,000 being accepted and signing a contract for work varying in length from between 3 to 12 months For a typical salary of around 1,125 pounds each. It was also revealed this week that there are now almost three million Romanian citizens in EU member states according to official statistics although the real number is probably far higher as many have not officially registered as having left the country. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) says in its latest report that Romania's accession to the European Union on 1 January 2007 was accompanied by a significant increase in migration movements, which continue to be strongly dominated by outflows. Although it put the official estimate at between 2.5 and 2.7 million it said figures from Romania sharply underestimate actual emigration since most emigrants do not use official channels (mediated contracts) and do not report their departure to the authorities. According to the World Bank, remittances to Romania sent by emigrant workers rose until 2008, when they totalled 6.25 billion pounds, but then fell during 2009. In the first quarter of this year, Romanians working abroad sent back home, through official channels, 770 million pounds, according to Central Bank data. Immigration to Romania was almost non-existent apart from immigrants arriving from neighbouring Moldova who are now offered fast track visas.
