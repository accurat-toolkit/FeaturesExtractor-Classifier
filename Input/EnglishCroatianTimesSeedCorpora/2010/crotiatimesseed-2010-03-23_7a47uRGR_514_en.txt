A tough nut teenager astonished medics when he walked into casualty with this 10-inch knife sticking right through his skull after a row over computer games. Xiao Wei, 16, was attacked when he fell out with a gang of thugs at an internet cafe he worked at in Mishazi, northeast China, after clocking up a high score on his favourite game, Counter Strike. He was left with a razor sharp kitchen knife plunged through his left temple and the half-inch tip of the blade emerging from his right temple. Amazed medics watched him stagger into casualty at the 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University, being held up by his pals. "We thought it was some sort of student prank until they got closer and he collapsed," said one. But surgeons - who took two hours to remove the blade - say Wei is likely to make a full recovery. Neurosurgery deputy director Professor Yan Shijun explained: "His face was covered in blood, but he was still conscious. I've never seen anything like it in 23 years as a surgeon." "The X-rays and CAT scans confirmed that the blade had not hit any main arteries or nerves. But the patient may have post-surgery complications like infections, brain damage or epileptic fits. "But he has regained consciousness and is really lucky," he added. Pal Huang Shen, 18, says he and Wei were attacked when a local gang tried to force Wei to load some unauthorised software onto the cafe's computers. "I'd been stabbed in my left arm, and when they had gone, I found Wei was lying on the ground with a knife in his head," he recalled. Police are now examining security CCTV of the attack.
