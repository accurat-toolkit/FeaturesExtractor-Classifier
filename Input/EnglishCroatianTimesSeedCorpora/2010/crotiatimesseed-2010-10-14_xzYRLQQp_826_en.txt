Political instability and fraudulent affairs that are surfacing on an almost daily basis could be affecting the real-estate market, which is suffering from a lack of demand. Apartments prices are falling, but few buyers are to be found. Experts say that the reason is not the lack of loans - although the banks did become more strict in their requirements - but rather that citizens are pessimistic about the future and are postponing their decision to buy property. Political instability and new fraudulent affairs that are being uncovered are further contributing to the climate of distrust. Vedranka Lika, the director of Collier International says: "The political situation drastically influences the decisions of buyers. The frequent illegal affairs and investigations are creating an atmosphere of insecurity which is strongly reflected on the real-estate market." The average price per square meter of new apartments sold in Croatia in the first six months of this year was 11,614 kuna or 1,585 Euros. That is 12.6 per cent less than the same period last year, the latest data from Central Bureau of Statistics shows. A decrease of 15.2 per cent, the largest drop of real estate prices in the country was registered in the capital, Zagreb. Compared to 2008 pre-crisis year when the average price in Zagreb was 14,860 kunas (2,028 Euros), this year's prices have plummeted by 18 per cent to 12,124 kunas (1,655 Euros). A huge supply of unsold apartments - some 10,000 in Zagreb alone - is contributing to the price drops. The future needs to be looked at with "conservative optimism," say experts. They hope that getting closer to the EU will have a positive effect and increase the interest of foreign investors and give new boost to the economy, the internet portal Business writes.
