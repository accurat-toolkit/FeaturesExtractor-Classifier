Farmers from Vukovar-Syrmia county in easternmost Croatia took to the streets at noon today (Mon) in protest over the government's violation of an agreement that was reached after massive farmers demonstraitons in March. The farmers are demanding a payout in promissory notes of 205 million kunas (28.5 million Euros) of subsidies owed to them since 2008, the payout of subsidies for cattle farmers and an agreement on this year's price of wheat.  They are also protesting against the announced 40 per cent cuts for wheat subsidies since they believe that the money is already ensured in this year's budget. Tomislav Pokrovac, president of Vukovar-Syrmia Croatian Peasant Association, said: "Like with the protest in March, at the beginning we will keep our tractors alongside the road and ask to have a conversation with the government and the Prime Minister who is avoiding us. We will protest like this for two to three days, and if no one invites us for negotiations, we will progressively increase the number of protestors and block the roads," Pokrovac said. The organisers are afraid that the government could use the unpredicted expenses incurred from the damages of recent floods as an excuse for not paying out the agreed amounts, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reports. Pokrovac said that the farmers are offering a solution to the government that would not require the state to allocate money from the budget, but rather forgive the farmers this years' concessions and the lease for the state-owned lands, as well as farmers' taxes. "It would not cost them anything, but of course they would get less money from the farmers," Pokrovac added.
