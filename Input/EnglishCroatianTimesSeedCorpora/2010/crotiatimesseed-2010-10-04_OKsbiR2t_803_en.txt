The average asking price of real estate in Croatia is down again this September  by 1.2 per cent compared to August, 5.3 per cent on a yearly basis, latest research by real estate portal CenterNekretnina shows. The analysis of 428,000 asking prices shows that prices in Zagreb fell 1.3 per cent compared to last month or 6.1 per cent on a yearly basis. The Adriatic coast experienced a similar drop of 1.1 per cent, but the annual comparison is slightly lower at 4.1 per cent. The average price per square metre for an apartment on the Adriatic was 1,926 Euros. In the most important market, Zagreb, the price drops have varied significantly depending on the location. The average asking price for an apartment in Zagreb was 1,818 Euros in September, 0.9 per cent less than last month and 4.7 per cent less than last year. In some areas, however, the prices are  20 to 30 per cent lower compared to prices in 2008. In Laniste, Spansko, Dubrava, Sesvete and parts of Tresnjevka, the prices have gone from between 1,600 and 2,000 Euros per square metre to 1,200 and 1,600 Euros. Further drops in prices are expected at these locations considering that the offer is significantly greater than demand, and buyers interested in these locations are holding off awaiting further decreases. But some other regions closer to the centre and considered good areas for family life  have gone down no more than 15 per cent, and the volume of transactions in those locations is relatively bigger. Apartments in Medvescak are the most expensive with average prices of 2,542 Euros per square metre, which is 40 per cent more than the average apartment rates. Real estate near Maksimir, close to Sljeme, Trnje, Crnomerac and certain part of Tresnjevka is also above average, the daily Slobodna Dalmacija writes.
