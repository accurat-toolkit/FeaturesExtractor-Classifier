President Ivo Josipovic received all 15 members of the Organizing Committee of Zagreb Pride 2010 and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersexual and Queer (LGBTIQ) Pride Parade yesterday (Wed). Josipovic is the first president to officially meet the LGBTIQ activists since the inception of the Pride Parade nine years ago. "For us, the LGBTIQ citizens, this was an important, historical moment in our efforts to build a more just, better and happier society for all people. In addition to the fact that this meeting took place immediately prior to the Pride Parade scheduled for 19 June, this is an important sign of support and encouragement for the Croatian LGBTIQ community in its  fight for equality of all," the organizers wrote in a press release. The President will not participate in the parade, but will address those present with a letter of support. The President's office said in a statement that the President supports the right to public expression of sexual preferences and that he condemns hate speeches, discrimination and violence. Even in his inauguration speech, the President Josipovic emphasized the importance of recognizing this right and that he would fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Youth of the Croatian Pure Party of Rights (Mladez HCSP) will once again organize a counter-march that will take place at the same time as the Pride Parade. "History has proven that once a society reaches a certain level of immorality, that society falls apart with drastic consequences. The destruction of the basic ethical and moral principles has far-reaching implications reflected on the entire society and the state including the economy, the judiciary and state administration in general." "The upcoming gay parade is the crown of such immorality that denies and ridicules all moral principles, laws of family, marriage, tradition, dignity and the faith of the entire society," Mladez HCSP said in a statement.
