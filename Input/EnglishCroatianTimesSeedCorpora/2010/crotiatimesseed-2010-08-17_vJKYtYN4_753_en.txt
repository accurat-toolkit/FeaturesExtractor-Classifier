While the biggest Croatian cities have already tried to adapt to the economic crisis by making budget cuts, bigger adjustments are yet to come, officials warn. The current cuts target mainly infrastructural projects that will lead to fewer sports halls, kindergartens, schools and paved roads, the daily Vecernji List has reported. The cities' mayors, however, have not yet begun to make major changes that could feature significant staff decreases in public administration. Few mayors have decided on cuts that would affect salaries and social services, but they predict that such changes are likely in the near future. Rijeka Mayor Vojko Obersnel believes that even though most cities have registered a dramatic drop in revenue during the last two years, tougher times are ahead. "We are expecting a continuing drop in revenue since the national government's measures have transferred the entire burden of savings to local governments. At the same time, the state is not ready to give up anything," Obernsnel, who is also the president of the Association of Cities, said. Shrinking revenues could lead to further debt in domestic and foreign markets, but such loans would require the approval of the Ministry of Finance and be subject to a repayment cap of 20 per cent of annual revenue. It is likely that Croatian cities will turn to European Union funding, which could in part solve the infrastructural problems, the daily has added. And while residents of Zagreb can boast about having the most revenue and the highest salaries in the country, they are also the most indebted considering the city's debts. With 6.9 billion kunas (951 million Euros) of debt, Zagreb leada Croatian cities with per-capita debt of 9,000 kunas (1,240 Euros).
