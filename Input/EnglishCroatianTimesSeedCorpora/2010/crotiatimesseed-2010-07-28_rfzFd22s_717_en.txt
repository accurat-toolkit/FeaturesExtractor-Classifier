Croatia is becoming a strategically important partner for the Serbian economy, latest analysis from the Serbian Chamber of Commerce shows. The trade between the two countries has grown seven times since the beginning of the decade, especially since the opening of the Central European Free Trade Agreement Zone in 2007. Croatia is Serbia's 10th most important trading partner, with  530.4 million Euros. During the first five months of 2010, total trade between the two nations reached 188 million Euros, almost a five per cent increase over the same period last year. Serbia's exports to Croatia grew by 7.5 per cent during that period, while Croatian exports to Serbia also grew by 3.1 per cent. Another interesting trend shows that the total amount of Croatian investments in Serbia surpassed half a billion Euros, which makes Croatia the sixth largest foreign investor in Serbia. Nineteen per cent of Croatia's total foreign investments are in Serbia, which makes it the second most favoured destination for Croatian investors after the Netherlands. Serbian investors, however, seem to be having a harder time breaking onto the Croatian markets. The only larger initiative at the moment is Rodoljub Draskovic's Swislion Takovo company's intent to invest 20 million Euros in a venture in Croatia. Draskovic, however, says that this not easy. "I don't have support neither here nor there. It is very hard to survive as a Serbian firm on the Croatian market." He says that political circumstances prevent Serbian firms from investing in Croatia. "We are not welcome. And none of the Serbian authorities are offering help." "At the same time, Croatian entrepreneurs have a much greater support from the state," he added.
