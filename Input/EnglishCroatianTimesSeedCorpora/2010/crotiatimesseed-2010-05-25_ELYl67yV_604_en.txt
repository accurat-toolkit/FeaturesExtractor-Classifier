Croatian farmers are asking for an increase in the current minimum support price of wheat, fearing that large companies will not be buying this year's yield. The farmers are asking for a raise from 0.75 kunas (0.10 Euros) to 0.85 (0.12 Euros) kunas per kilogram. They are also ready to demand that the State buy all of the wheat. Since this year's yield is expected to reach 700,000 tons, such State intervention could cost almost 600 million kunas (82.5 million Euros). The State paid 540 million kunas (74.2 million) for wheat last year, the Ministry of Agriculture says. "We can discuss changing the minimum support prices when harvest begins and we see what the situation on the market is," the Ministry said. According to some sources close to the Minister, the Ministry is not yet willing to negotiate buying the wheat, but rather ensuring that it is guarded in tanks until the market offers better prices. Matija Brlosic, the president of Brazda Association, says the farmers cannot accept lower prices because of their own expenses of production. If big companies do not want to buy their wheat, he expects the state to ensure that they can at least store this year's crops. Currently the price of wheat is 0.77 kunas (0.16 Euros). The price is also low on the foreign markets, a reason behind the fact that the excess had not been exported. Agrokor - one of the biggest agricultural companies in Croatia -  says that the company still has 250,000 tons of wheat that they have not yet sold since the price is lower than last year's buying price of 0.95 kunas (0.13 Euros) per kilogram. "Since we still have large supplies and we do not have additional storage space, we did not negotiate production and we will not buy this year's yield," Agrokor said. A month and a half before the start of the harvest season, it looks as though the farmers may take to the streets again in another protest, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes.
