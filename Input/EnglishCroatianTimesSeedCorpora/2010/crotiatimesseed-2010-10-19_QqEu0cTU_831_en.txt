An Association of Croatian Returnees has been founded in United States. "The essence of the idea is to represent and defend the interests of Croatian returnees as a part of Croatian society", Zdravko Belancic, the president of the Association told Croatian Times from Cleveland, Ohio in the United States. "The idea of establishing this kind of association will help not only the diaspora but also all Croatian citizens in Croatia itself. The association was founded in the small village of Bilice near Sibenik, Croatia where a small group of returnees first came up with the idea. The association was registered with the Croatian authorities in the county of Sibenik. About fifty people attended the inaugural meeting and have already joined the Association. Association President Zdravko Belancic from Cleveland, USA, is also a returnee emigrant. He splits his time between the two countries and is therefore perfectly familiar with everything that is important for the Association. For now the association does not intend to act as a political party or be activated as a new political force, but intends to represent the interests of all returnees, emigrants and their descendants, link them with each other on a global level and grow into a strong international association, in a network modelled after similar organizations in other countries. "The association will cooperate with the Croatian authorities, and if it grows into a strong global network it hopes to be able to work on promoting the interests of Croatian emigrants and returnees, to defend their interests and the recognition of their rights, interests and opportunities in the Croatian legislation. At the same time the Association will work to promote the idea of connecting the Croatian Diaspora and Homeland in every sense: social, business, investment, culture, tourism, etc.
