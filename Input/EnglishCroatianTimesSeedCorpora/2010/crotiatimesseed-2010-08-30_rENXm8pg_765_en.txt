While Rovinj (Istria) was on the top of the gay tourist destinations in Croatia, its popularity seems to be waning - with Pula slowly taking over the lead. Vanja Berc, a co-owner of an agency in Pula, says that she has noted more interest in other destinations. "This winter I noticed a growing interest of gay tourists who are looking to come to Istria, Lovran, Opatija, Porec and Umag, and recently to Pula and Labin. They ask for Rovinj, but I do not believe that it is as "in" as in the last few years," she said. A recent arrival of some 2,800 gay visitors on a cruise ship to Dubrovnik has sparked an interest in this population's potential for Croatian tourism. "On average, the homosexual guests stay at least from five days to two weeks, they spend a lot and it would be a shame if Croatia did not take advantage of the interests of that population," says Berc. The gay population likes personalized offers that include adventure packages and good night life, as well as tolerant surroundings. Berc estimates around five per cent of Croatia's tourists belong to this group, or a respectable figure of 400,000. Gay activist Dalibor Stanic says that Croatia is opening up more to gay tourism. "A few years ago there was an uproar about Hvar, a favourite gay destination. That passed, but my friends do not like places that are too often in the news and maybe that is why Rovinj is not as attractive. Gay couples usually like more peaceful places." Stanic says that it would be good if there were more agencies that could cater to this population as they are known to spend a lot and love to travel, the daily Vecernji List writes. Gay tourists find recommendations most often on gay internet portals and up until now, Rovinj was most often mentioned for several establishments known to be more open to these couples.
