The American G2 Investment Group toured Istria on Sunday with an interest in building a Guggenheim Museum in Pula. If the idea were realized, it would be the biggest American investment in Croatia worth one billion dollars (819 million Euros). At the same time, together with New York, Venice, Berlin and Bilbao, Pula would find itself on the prestigious map of Guggenheim museums. Istria County head Ivan Jakovcic said that the Americans' proposals are expected in September, by when the city would have its spatial planning documents ready, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List reports. "We expect that in September we could sign the agreement about the realization of the project,"Jakovcic said adding that the American investors would finance construction in an area where former army barracks are located and other port areas that are currently abandoned. "I am convinced that Istria, in a tough worldwide competition that include Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai, has realistic chances to win and get the Guggenheim Museum - Jankovcic said. Pula's mayor Boris Miletic expressed his satisfaction with Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor's support for the realization of the project. "If Pula receives half a million tourists annually because of the museum, that would be more than extraordinary. That would mean a revival of the entire economy, and not only the tourist expansion" Miletic said, emphasizing that the Guggenheim's museum in Spain is a big magnet for tourists that had revived the once impoverished economy of the Basque region. But the "Guggenheim effect" is not guaranteed everywhere. For example the Guggenheim museum in Las Vegas failed, while the one in Rio de Janeiro was never built because of political resistance the project received.
