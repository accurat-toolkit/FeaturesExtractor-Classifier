On the face of it, this monster clock is a dead ringer for Big Ben - except it's twice the size. The massive timepiece - built by British firm Smith of Derby - stands nearly 400ft high in its tower in Ganzhou, southern China, and is said to be the largest mechanical clock in the world. Makers say the clock is so massive that it had to swap traditional steel hands for hi-tech carbon fibre from F1 racing car technology because the originals would have been too heavy. The faces are 13 metres in diameter - almost twice the size of those on the Houses of Parliament tower - while the minute hand is 7.8 metres long. And instead of just traditional Roman numerals, the huge dial has been decorated with signs of the zodiac for the luck-obsessed Chinese. Managing director Bob Betts explained: "It's so large the first challenge was to make it safe. Then we had to make it spectacular." It is the first time in 60 years that the company which was founded in 1846 has built a mechanical clock, saying that all large clock towers nowadays tend to use electrical motors. It is mainly involved in repairing the existing clock towers it delivered before the 1950s. The tower includes a viewing gallery so visitors can inspect the movement, which is made from hardened steel with bronze finishing and brass and gold-plated components. Despite weighing 10 tonnes it was flown to China so that the 1 million pound project would be finished this month exactly one year after building work started. It comes with a 100-year guarantee, though the company says it should last much longer. A spokesman for the Ganzhou Expressway Company who commissioned the clock said it chose a mechanical clock because it wanted a historical feel, and turned to the UK on the advice of experts. "Not only will it record the time, but it will also remind people not to waste time," said the spokesman.
