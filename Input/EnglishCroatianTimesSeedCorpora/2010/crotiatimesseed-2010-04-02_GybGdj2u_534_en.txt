Italian detectives have flown to the United Kingdom to liaise with British officers about a DNA sample that may solve two murders. The body of the first victim Elisa Claps, who was 16 when she vanished in 1993, was 'discovered' last week when workmen were carrying out repairs on a church roof. DNA samples were taken from her body and Italian police want to compare these with samples from Danilo Restivo, an Italian from Potenza who moved to Bournemouth ten years ago. Restivo is also a suspect in the murder of Heather Barnett, 42, a seamstress who was found mutilated and with locks of hair in her hands in her home in Bournemouth, Dorset. Restivo is known by Italian police to have a fetish for cutting girls' hair. Restivo, 38, who still lives across the road from where Mrs Barnett's body was found by her two children, has denied any involvement with both cases and has been questioned by both Italian and Dorset police. The DNA samples taken from the body of student Elisa Claps should be completed next week and will be sent straight to the UK from the laboratory in Italy where the tests are being carried out. The teenager's partially mummified and skeletal corpse was found in the roof of the Most Holy Trinity Church in Potenza, southern Italy. Italian police confirmed that they had travelled to Dorset so that as soon as the DNA sample had been received they could make a formal request to British officials to have it compared with a sample from Restivo. Should the sample match they were prepared to ask for his extradition immediately. Meanwhile Italian police confirmed that The Most Holy Trinity Church in Potenza, southern Italy - where Elisa Claps' body was found on 17th March - would remain sealed while investigations continue.
