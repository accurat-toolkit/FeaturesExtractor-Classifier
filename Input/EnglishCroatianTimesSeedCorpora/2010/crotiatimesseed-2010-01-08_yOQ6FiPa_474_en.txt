Phyllis Wheaton from Calgary, Alberta in Canada is writing a book about the Izzy Doll, a doll made to bring comfort and joy to children who have lost them for many reasons. Wheaton's aim is to locate some of the children, now adults, who were recipients of the earliest Izzy Dolls, small hand-knit dolls named after Canadian Forces' Master Corporal Mark Isfeld, who died in 1994 while clearing land-mines in Croatia. Wheaton said to Croatian Times: "I would be interested in finding a way to contact some of these children now grown and ask how receiving a doll helped comfort them in any way." The Izzy Doll boom was initiated by Isfeld when he was on tour in Croatia. During his tour there, he always was deeply touched by the needs of children. He sent a photo he had taken of a doll in a pile of rubble to his mother in Canada, explaining that "the little girl has lost her doll  and a doll has lost her little girl". He also noted that the children didn't have a childhood. His mom decided to make little dolls that could fit into her soldier son's pocket so he could give them to children he met. After his death, many other soldiers continued to distribute the dolls. More and more Canadian moms and grandmothers began making the dolls in the hope they would comfort and bring joy to children. As a result of a veterans' organization called ICROSS Canada, Izzy Dolls were distributed to the poorest of the poor, to orphaned babies dying of Aids, and to many children who would hold on to their Izzy Doll. To date, over 800,000 dolls have been hand made and distributed to children. All those who recognized themselves in the story and have received a doll may contact office(at)croatiantimes.com.
