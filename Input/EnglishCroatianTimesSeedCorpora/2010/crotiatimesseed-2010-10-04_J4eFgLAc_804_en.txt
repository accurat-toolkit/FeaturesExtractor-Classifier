Swiss officials have refused to comment on claims that the supergrass who blew the whistle on thousands of wealthy tax dodgers has mysteriously died in a Swiss prison. Until now even the man's age and nationality were unknown and it was reported he had been given a secret identity because he had amassed so many powerful enemies. But now it has been revealed the man was Austrian, aged 42, from Tyrol, and was found dead in his prison cell in Winterthur, Switzerland, the Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung says. The paper claims Swiss authorities have refused to give out any further information on the incident. It also reports that the man's family were unaware he had been arrested. According to the article the 42-year-old raked in millions for handing a data disc carrying information about German tax evaders to the German government. Reports suggest the CD contained secret data on around 2,000 Germans who illegally stashed hundreds of millions of pounds on accounts in Switzerland to save taxes. Dozens of wealthy Germans got cold feet after the deal was made public earlier this year and decided to hand themselves in. German newspapers say that many of those who confessed guilty of tax evasion to escape charges were not mentioned on the data disc provided by the Austrian. The nationality of the man who tipped off German officials has previously not been revealed. Speculations had it he might be Swiss having worked for the country's financial authority who would now go into hiding abroad with a new nationality to escape angered Swiss authorities. The debate over whether Germany should buy the top secret data caused a diplomatic rift between the country and Switzerland - which is widely regarded as a tax haven and a popular location to keep money for people from all over the world due to its high banking secrecy.
