Crisis figures have confirmed Zagreb's dominance in Croatia's economy with 61 per cent of all entrepreneurial investments ending up in the capital, according to a report in the daily Vecernji List. The paper says the capital also produces 52 per cent of all entrepreneurial income, 56 per cent of total profits and employs 40 per cent of all workers. Main economic indicators also show it is seven to eight times stronger than Istria, Primorje and Split-Dalmatia counties, which are the first to follow. The average salaries of 5,542 kunas (767 Euros) that Zagreb's entrepreneurs pay are 20 per cent higher than the second-place Istria, and 70 per cent higher than the worst-off Virovitica-Podravina County where salaries are 3,320 kunas (460 Euros) on average. The data shows big regional inequalities with jobs concentrated in Zagreb and regional centres. Eastern Croatia has not yet managed to recover from the war and transitional traumas, while tourism in Dalmatia and Primorje has not yet compensated for loss of industry in those regions, the daily writes. Although small private companies have the biggest share in the total number of businesses, several counties depend on four or five large companies. Even a small disturbance in these firms could be very costly for the entire region, analysts warns. Last year 19 out of 21 of Croatia's counties experienced a decrease in investment, research from Financial Agency (Fina) shows. Only Sisak-Moslavina County and Sibenik-Knin county registered an increase, while Zagreb had a 3.3 per cent drop. The biggest loss of investment was in Lika-Senj County with 64 per cent.
