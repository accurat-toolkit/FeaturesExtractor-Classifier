Croatia is no longer on the list of top 30 most desirable destinations for investment in retail, research by consulting firm A.T. Kearny shows. According to the Global Retail Development Index (GRDI), Croatia, held 24th place last year and was seen as an attractive destination for investment of global retail chains. But since then, a fall in consumption and the satiation of the market has affected its ranking. Zlatko Bazianec, senior consultant with A.T.Kearney said: "Compared to other countries in the region which are on the list - amongst them Albania, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina - the Croatian market is slowly closing.  International chains like Spar, Kaufland and Lidl have already entered our market and managed to achieve a considerable growth and has prevented other players from entering." "On the other hand, potential investors are awaiting Croatia's entrance into the EU when an easing of entrance barriers and simplification of the process is expected," he added. The results of the investigation show global retail chains are focusing on developing countries with big potential for growth.  While many are concentrating on BRIC states (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the research also shows that investors' interests have also turned to countries in the Persian Gulf (Kuwait, Saudia Arabia, United Arab Emirates) as well as South America (Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Peru). According to the GRDI, the top 30 countries are: China, Kuwait, India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Chile, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Peru, Russia, Tunis, Albania, Egypt, Vietnam, Maroko, Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Algeria, Phillipenes, Dominican Republic, South Africa, Mexico, Colombia, El Salvador, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Guatemala.
