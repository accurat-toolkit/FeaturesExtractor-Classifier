Army bosses are to recruit a regiment made up entirely of eunuchs to act as special border guards around India. Minister Tako Dabi from the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh which has an extensive border with China said: "Eunuchs are healthy, they are strong and they were not always neglecting their duties chasing women." The Indians were responding to an announcement last week from neighbouring China that they were to recruit husband and wife soldier teams to share "love nests" in remote rural outposts often hundreds of kilometres away from the nearest large town and without mains electricity or water supplies. Regimental commander Li Gang admitted the remoteness and the isolation meant that many soldiers simply lacked the self discipline to handle the isolation and monotony that's inherent in frontier duty. He said: "There is not much that happens there, yet those areas must still be maintained and patrolled." India however has decided to tackle the problem by using eunuchs. India is the only country where the tradition of eunuchs is prevalent today. There are estimated to be almost 1 million eunuchs in India - most of whom live by begging or working in the sex trade where they are used for anal sex. The eunuchs - known as hijras - also earn money from their more traditional role of blessing newborn children, weddings, housewarmings and other auspicious occasions. Some of the eunuchs are born that way while others are operated on by the eunuch community itself which is constantly recruiting new members. Minister Tako Dabi added: "There are so many of them and most of them have lived very healthy lifestyles and look after themselves. "Currently, most of are sex workers or beg on the streets so it would be much better to deploy them in this kind of work where they would not miss the company of the opposite sex."
