Croatians may soon be able to declare personal bankruptcy as one of the new proposed government measures that should bring the economy out of the rut and back on track. The measure could be converted into law at the earliest at the end of this year and the next two would be spent on preparing its implantation.  That means that for the first time ever Croatians would be able to file for personal bankruptcy - probably from 2013. Around 30,000 Croatians are on the edge of a ruin while 5,000 are facing bankruptcy, according to the Croatian daily Vecernji List.  The personal debt in Croatia is around 120 billion kunas (16.5 billion Euros). Out of that only one third are loans for "lasting values" like mortgages for property.  Croatians are also 40 billion (5.5 billion Euros) in debt for vehicle purchases and the rest is spent on everything from vacations to furniture and clothes. But for the first time last year the total amount of personal loans in Croatia fell by three percent especially for purchases of vehicles and for credit cards, showing the effects of the crisis. While the state is working on its measures, the creditors are also finding their own ways of dealing with debtors, restructuring the debt and offering an extension for payback, with little interest in repossessing apartments and houses that cannot be sold on the market. Bankruptcy experts from about ten countries that participated at a meeting in Dubrovnik last year said that bankruptcy is just one of the possible solutions, with most serious consequences. It is also one of the most expensive solutions because it engages many professionals that would personally oversee bankruptcy cases.  Croatia would need at minimum 300 of these professionals, they agreed.
