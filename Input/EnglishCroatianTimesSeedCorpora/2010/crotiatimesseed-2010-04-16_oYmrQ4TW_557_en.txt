There were chaotic scenes at ferry ports in France as holidaymakers and businessmen who turned up en masse by taxi, plane and train in the hope of travelling back to the UK by ferry were refused tickets. Ferry ports have been turning away thousands of foot passengers saying only people in vehicles or on bikes would be allowed on board. The news meant flourishing sales for local bike sellers as would be travellers snapped up bikes to qualify for places on the ferry. At Dunkirk yesterday (Fri) London bankers dressed in designer suits carrying designer luggage were claiming their bicycles had been stolen in the hope of being able to qualify for a place on board. Other businessmen stood in their Armani suits hoping to thumb a lift from truckers or in one case hitch a lift in a packed Romanian minivan in an attempt to get on board. "Brits are storming our bike shop, desperate for any model possible to be allowed on board. We are nearly sold out. It is doing great for our business. We have never sold so many bikes in one day," said Antoine Benarroche, a local bike seller. Other desperate businessmen hired local taxis to get on board and take them back to the UK. Norfolkline Spokesperson Susan Granger said: "It is still possible to take bookings for cyclists on our ferry's, but we are not taking bookings for foot passengers." P&O spokesperson Brian Rees also confirmed it is not possible for foot passengers without an existing reservation to book a place on board their ferries from France to the UK. They are now fully booked due to passengers returning for the end of the Easter holidays and the closure of airports throughout Europe.
