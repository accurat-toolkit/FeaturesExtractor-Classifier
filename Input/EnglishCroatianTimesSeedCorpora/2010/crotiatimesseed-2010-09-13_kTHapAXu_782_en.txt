An Italian security firm boss who reportedly helped the Camorra Mafia to monitor police movements has himself been kidnapped for a 4.1 million pound ransom outside Nola near Naples, police said. Antonio Buglione, 54, ran a private security firm in Nola, 20km (12.4 miles) east of Naples together with his brother Carmine. Another brother, Carlo, said the family had received a ransom demand for five million euros. After combing the countryside around Nola, Carabinieri found Antonio Buglione's abandoned car. Buglione is also the brother of Rosa Buglione, mayoress of a town near Nola called Saviano where the firm has another base. The security entrepreneur is said to have had past ties with the Neapolitan Camorra mafia and has also been involved in probes involving local politicians. According to prosecutors, for several years from the late 1990s top Camorra boss Carmine Alfieri used Buglione's security guards and private surveillance patrols to keep tabs on police movements. In 2008 Buglione was accused with a regional councillor of the centre-left Democratic Party, Roberto Conte, of fraudulently inflating rents in the Naples area. In 2010 the businessman was placed under investigation along with a Senator of the centre-right People of Freedom (PdL) party on suspicion of money laundering and fraudulent bankruptcy. Buglione's first brush with the law came in 1993 when he was wounded in the face in an ambush. Two years late, in 1995, he was arrested in a probe into alleged irregularities in the concession of licenses for security firms. Ex-Naples police chief Umberto Improta was also involved while a PdL MP, university medicine professor Carmine Mensorio, committed suicide after being named in the probe. It was at this time that Buglione's alleged links with the Alfieri clan first came to light and the security manager was accused of attempted extortion.
