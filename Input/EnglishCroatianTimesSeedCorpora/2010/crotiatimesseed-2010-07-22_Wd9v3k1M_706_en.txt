The Thor Steinar clothing label much loved by Neo Nazis has lost a crucial battle to have a rival label featuring a Hitler moustache wearing stork banned. The rival Heinar the Stork "Storch Heinar" label was set up by left-wing German MP Mathias Brodkorb. But in a pre-trial hearing a Nuremberg judge warned that much of the complaint was unfounded. Thor Steinar's manufacturer, Media Tex, vowed nonetheless to press on with its case, which is due to be held on August 11. Heinar the Stork products sold under the motto "Der F hrer had only one egg" have sold well since the label was launched in 2008. It is a reference to a popular British World War II-era song that claimed Hitler only had one ball. MediaTex claimed in court that its reputation was suffering through the satirical rival label -- which it claims was based on their own logo and was a play on words for their own brand name. But the judge Horst Rottmann ruled that there was not a relevant similarity between the two logos and also there was clearly different interpretations from Thor Steinar and Storch Heinar. Rottmann also said that the Storch Heinar labels can also use artistic freedom grounds to argue their case As they were not making a profit with the project. Thor Steinar that was founded in 2002 gained an immediate following among the far-right scene partially because of its deliberate emphasis on Nordic mythology, an important element to Nazi ideas about racial purity. This is despite the fact that the company that owns Thor Steinar, Mediatex GmbH, has always denied that it was targeting neo-Nazis. The makers of the Storch Heinar range however, offer T-shirts, hooded sweatshirts, dresses and coffee cups decorated with graphics that make jokes at the expense of various neo-Nazi icons.
