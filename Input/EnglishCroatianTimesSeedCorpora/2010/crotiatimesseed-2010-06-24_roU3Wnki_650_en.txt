The founder of sinister suicide group Dignitas has become a multi-millionaire since setting up the self help group, a new report claims today (thursday). Ludwig Minelli was a penniless businessmen when he set up Dignitas in Switzerland a decade ago, says a new study of the organisation. Now he owns a luxury villa and is worth millions, says the investigation by respected Swiss newspaper Beobachter. The report has reignited criticism of Dignitas and brings into question whether it has stuck to Switzerland's strict assisted suicide laws which prevent anyone helping someone to die from profiting by their death. And it accused the organisation of using Swiss privacy laws to avoid publishing full accounts or expenses records for five years. Minelli himself - says the report - went from being virtually penniless to amassing a fortune worth two million Swiss francs - around 1.3 million GBP - in just a decade. In 1998 when he was setting up the group he said he had no personal fortune and would not take a salary from Dignitas. He has since claimed that some of his wealth comes from an inheritance from his mother. Dignitas had faced stern criticism for accepting generous donations from its suicide clients, in apparent breach of Swiss law. One patient is said to have signed over more than 60,000 GBP to Minelli's organisation as well as the official fee of 6,000 GBP. Swiss prosecutor Andreas Brunner said: "We have never had a good look at their bookkeeping but in order to demand that we need a good reason and a concrete example that there is something suspicious to investigate. "The tax officials no doubt have a good idea what is there but they have no obligations to publish that. He has promised for years to make the accounts public but it has never happened."
