President Ivo Josipovic has said every victim of the Homeland war deserves respect and honour and a memorial, if the initiative for building of one exists. His statement to Croatian daily Jutarnji List comes in response to the president of Civic Committee for Human Rights Zoran Pusic's idea to build a memorial for victims of the Lora Croatian Army jail in Split where Serbian war prisoners were tortured and killed. President said that while such commemoration is important, he believes that all war crimes that took place in the territory of the former Yugoslavia first and foremost must be processed. "The fact that the judiciary process for the "Lora case" has been undertaken, that inhuman treatment of civilians was proven and that the accused were found guilty for war crimes against civilians was the most important act," the President said. Pusic, encouraged by the President's reaction, said that he would begin an initiative to erect a memorial. He said such a move would be "a big civilizing step for Croatia and a good message for the spiritual health of the Croatian nation." A veteran and former prisoner of Serb concentration camps Predrag Matic said that this is a delicate matter, but as a victim of war crimes he believes that a "crime is a crime." He called the crimes committed in Lora "a stain on our just struggle for independence. "I am proud that Croatia had the strength to process that crime," he added. Dujomir Marasovic, the chief of the Split Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) did not want to comment on the initiative, but said that Pusic with his one-sided approach is "deepening the wounds and spoiling the relationship between Croats and Serbs." On the other hand, Marin Jurjevic, the chief of the Social Democratic Party in Split, considers the idea positive and good for Croatia. "That memorial would point to a difficult time. It would not insult anyone, nor would it bring into question the essence of the Homeland War, " he said.
