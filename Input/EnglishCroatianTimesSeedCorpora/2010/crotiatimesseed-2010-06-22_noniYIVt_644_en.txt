Expenditures for hardware, software and IT services fell by 16.9 per cent in 2009 to 895 million Euros according the study by IDC Adriatics. The market share of IT services was 35.4 per cent, with software taking 16.3 per cent and the share of hardware falling to 48.3 per cent. The sale of hardware registered a significantly greater drop than the average, or 25.3 per cent.  Sale of printers suffered the greatest drop (40.4 per cent), while the sales of personal computers registered a fall of 38.9 per cent, forcing domestic distributors and retailers to restructure and make staff cuts. Boris Zitnik, director of IDC Adriatics said: "The economic crisis, which spread onto the domestic market in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in 2009, strongly influenced the fall of demand in all consumer segments in particular the public sector, households and a large part of the corporate sector. The IT expenditures of bank institutions and the telecommunications industry in 2009 registered a smaller decline." With IT spending of 201 Euros per capita, last year Croatia reached 29.8 per cent of the average per capita IT spending of the EU27. It was far behind the developed Scandinavian countries (Denmark 1,590 Euros and Sweden 1,248 Euros), but it was ahead of Poland (175 Euros), Bulgaria (116 USD) and Romania (61 Euros). Croatia's share in the total IT spending in the Adriatic region was 33 per cent. IDC expects that the IT expenditures will see a modest decline this year, while it expects a growth in the next five years of 7.1 per cent that would reach 1.3 billion Euros by 2014, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reports.
