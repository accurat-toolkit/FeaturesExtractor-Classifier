Croatian singer Severina could be entering political waters soon, according to news portal Sarajevo-x.com. Severina "has an intention of getting involved in politics," and because she "loves new challenges," she is attracted to it, journalist Jasenko Korjenic wrote. Her manager Tomica Petrovic has vehemently denied the singer had made any such statements or has any such intentions. The star's recent activism on the political scene, however, has convinced many that these intentions could be true, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. She has used her popularity to comment on political developments and influence social change, taking on the Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor over such issues as Croatia's restrictive laws guiding medically assisted reproduction and unemployment. She mocked the PM's love of brooches by wearing one herself with the number 317,625 on it representing the number of unemployed at the time. Most recently she was the first public figure to sign a petition calling for a referendum on labour law reforms proposed by the government. Judging from her recent activities, if Severina were to officially join politics, she is likely to be on the side of the left even though she was a conservative icon during the war in the 90s. Since then, however, she has made statements against the conservative government, as well as writing controversial songs attacking the Catholic Church. But in her one only officially authorised political interview in last August in Vecernji List), Severina said she would never be interested in politics, "not under any conditions."
