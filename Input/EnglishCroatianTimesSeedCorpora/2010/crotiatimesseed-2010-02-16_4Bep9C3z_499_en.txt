Couples rate keeping their home tidy more important than sex, a new survey on domestic bust-ups reveals. The study - conducted by German online dating firm Parship - says who does household chores is the biggest source of domestic strife for women. Women rated the problem top with 30 per cent of those asked saying housework was the single largest cause of rows. Men rated it almost as highly with 24 per cent saying who does which chores creates the most arguments. And nearly a quarter in the survey of 2,000 people - 22 per cent - of both sexes said not a partner not listening to them caused anger and rows. Traditional flare-up points like interference from meddling in-laws are becoming less important, the survey shows, with only 17 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men saying it was an important source of rows. And being too busy for a home life rated the highest source of bust-ups for men at 29 per cent and 22 per cent of women. But sex ranked last on the lists with only eight per cent of women and nine per cent of men rating it worth rowing about. Now experts say that rows could be the answer to saving a rocky relationship instead of a sign that it's going to fall apart. Parship relationship expert Eric Hegmann explained: "It can be better to address unpleasant topics respectfully and constructively. "That is much better for a lasting partnership than to always avoid conflict whenever possible." RESULTS IN FULL: 1 About the distribution of tasks in the household (30%) 2.
