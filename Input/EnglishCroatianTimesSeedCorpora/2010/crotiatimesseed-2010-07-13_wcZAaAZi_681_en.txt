Austrian Social Democratic (SP ) Chancellor Werner Faymann said he is convinced Croatia will get through the credit crunch after meeting the country's Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor in Zagreb yesterday, Austrian Times has reported. The chancellor praised the country as a "role model for the whole region", claiming its business relationship with Austria was strong enough to ensure both countries will handle the blows they had been forced to deal with after the global economic downturn kicked in around one and a half years ago. Klaus Mangold, the president of the German-Croatian Chamber of Industry and Commerce, said at a recent economic summit he hoped his country would soon become the biggest investor in Croatia. Germany has invested 2.6 billion Euros in Croatia over the last 16 years. The Croatian Times reports Mangold praised Croatia as a "leading country in the region in many ways".
