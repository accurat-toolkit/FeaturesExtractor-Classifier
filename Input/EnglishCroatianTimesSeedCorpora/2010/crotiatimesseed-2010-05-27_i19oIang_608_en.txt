Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor has said she accepts in principle the suggestion of coalition partner Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) to tax income over 25,000 kunas (3,441 Euros) by 50 percent. Presidential economic advisor Boris Cota is behind the suggestion, as well as Josip Budimir, one of the directors of food manufacturing company Franck. The agreement may show that the President and the government have been able to find a common language at least in the economic sector if not in other areas, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List repots. The HSLS proposes taxing income higher than 25,000 kunas (3,441 Euros) by 50 percent. This is more of a symbolic gesture that is unlikely to fill the state's cash registers, but would show the government's social sensitivity, the paper writes. The other tax brackets would remain the same as outlined in the new programme that takes effect in July. Income below 1,800 kunas (248 Euros) will not be taxed, but those up to 3,600 kunas (495 Euros) would be taxed 12 percent, and income over 3,600 and less than 19,800 (2,725 Euros) by 25 percent. Those who earn between 10,800 kuna and 25, 000 (3,441 Euros) would pay 40 per cent tax, and finally 50 per cent would pay all those with higher earnings. This last bracket included members of the government and parliamentary representatives, but also managers of the public firms whose salaries, despite the government's decision, have not been cut to the maximum of 17,000 kunas (2,340 Euros). The HSLS is trying to introduce the new rate on 1 July along with other reforms, but there are some who would prefer to wait until next year.
