A contract should be signed by the end of the year with a private partner that would build a new airport terminal building, Director of Zagreb's airport Tonci Peovic has said. The new terminal, Peovic suggests, should be built in three phases. In the first phase a passenger building of 40,000 square meters - enough space for three to four million passengers - should be constructed, with three aero-bridges connecting the building with the planes. The first phase would cost 150 million Euros. In the second phase, when passenger numbers reach five million, the terminal should be expanded with aerobridges on the western side of the building, costing an additional 72 million Euros. In the third phase, aerobridges would be added to the eastern side of the terminal at a cost of 44 million Euros. The first phase is expected to be completed by the year 2015. Peovic has also suggested several financing options (Build, operate, transfer - BOT, owners' own money and loans, European Union Cohesion Funds or cooperation with a strategic partner). The government will make its decision next month, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reports. Peovic considers the BOT model to be the best solution since the project would be carried out by a company that would invest money in the building of the terminal and for that reason would also have the greatest interest in attracting new passengers. That private partner would then manage the airport for 20 to 30 years and afterwords give the management right back to the owners, in this case the state, Zagreb city, Zagreb County, and the city of Velika Gorica.
