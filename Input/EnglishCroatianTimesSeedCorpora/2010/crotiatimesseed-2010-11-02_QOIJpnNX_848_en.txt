Some 100 Croatian children will leave orphanages for foster care families or be adopted by 2012, according to the government's new plan aimed at the de-institutionalization of social care. Under the new plan, the homes would not house more than 50 children (30 by 2016), bringing the total number in the institutions from current 2,700 to 500 in that time.  Six of the 22 facilities would be closed, the daily Vecernji List writes.  Starting the same year, the children under the age of three would no longer be placed in these institutions. The abovementioned changes are part of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare's Master Plan aimed at de-institutionalization and transformation of social care facilities in Croatia.  The plan requires all children's homes to develop their individual plans by the end of the year, to be reviewed by the Ministry. The goal of the new plan is to change the ratio of the institutionalized and alternative care - foster homes and adoptions - to 19 per cent and 89 per cent, respectively.  Currently the foster and adoptive parent's share in the system of care for children without parental supervision is 59 per cent. The plan would also regulate changes for the institutions caring for children with developmental difficulties and adults with disabilities. Some 2,800 people were housed in these institutions last year, a number that the Ministry plans to reduce by 30 per cent by focusing on enabling those with milder disabilities who do not need constant care to live in a more independent, organized housing under the  supervision of professionals. Starting December 2012 these homes would no longer be accepting children below the age four.
