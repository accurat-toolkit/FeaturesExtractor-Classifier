A Croatian presidential candidate is in hot water after he was accused of stealing the Star Wars theme music for his election campaign. The Star Wars theme music is banned from use in any political campaign and even if the organisers of the campaign for Milan Bandic had requested to use it they would have been refused. However Croatian independent record label, Dancing Bear, which discovered the theft says that the Star Wars film theme had not been officially obtained and its use was illegal in TV commercial for the upcoming presidential elections. They said Milan Bandic, who is an independent presidential candidate, should immediately stop commercial broadcasting using the music and visual effects from the Star Wars is films. Dancing Bear head Davor Varga said that as well as not paying for the copyright it was also a double problem because the 'Star Wars (Main Theme)' tune written by John T. Williams as banned in any use for a political purpose. The Jutarnji list daily newspaper quoted Bandic election team as saying it was not their problem because they ordered and bought a finished commercial from the Production Hrg company and it was not their job to make sure copyrights have been applied for. They said: " We received the commercial as a final product, and it was not our job to do anything more because it was the job of the Production Hrg company." Milan Bandic faces leftist Social Democratic Party's candidate Ivo Josipovic in the second round of the presidential elections scheduled for 10 January. Milan Bandic himself used to be a member of Social Democratic Party before disobeying the party leaders and launching his own presidential campaign. He is also the current mayor of the Croatian capital Zagreb.
