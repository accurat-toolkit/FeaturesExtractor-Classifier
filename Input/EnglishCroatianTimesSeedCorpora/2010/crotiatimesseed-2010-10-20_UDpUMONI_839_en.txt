Serbian President Boris Tadic is preparing for a three-day visit to Croatia in November, the Serbian press has reported. The Serbian head of state will be hosted by his Croatian counterpart, President Ivo Josipovic. He is also likely to meet other high-ranking officials including the Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and the Speaker of the Parliament Luka Bebic. On the meeting's agenda are various questions including the return of refugees, protection of their property, solutions to housing questions, and the preservation of the Serbian minority's language in Croatia. But one of the main issues are the countries' mutual accusations of genocide before the International Court of Justice in Hague. Croatia sued Serbia in 2008 for genocide during the war that took place between 1991 and 1995 in the former Yugoslavia. Serbia countered with a similar lawsuit last year, accusing Croatia of genocide against Serbs. Earlier this year both presidents agreed that it would be more desirable to resolve these questions outside of the Court. The Serbian press writes that the only precondition for the country to withdraw its accusation is if Zagreb does it first.  It is believed that Tadic will use the upcoming visit to discuss the issue with PM Kosor who is seen as one of the strongest opponents to dropping the charges.  She has said that she would prefer that some other open questions are resolved before this is done, referring to the arrest of the Serbian general Ratko Mladic, the dispute over borders and the restitution of cultural treasures. Tadic may also visit Vukovar this time, one of the places in Croatia that had been most devastated by the war, the daily Vecernji List writes.
