Croatia has used 90 percent of its pre-accession funds (PRI) assigned for helping the future members states transition to membership, said Minister of Finance Ivan Suker at today's (Thu) information session "Possibilities Through EU funds - Croatia in Europe, Europe for Croatia" held in Zagreb. The session was meant to give all the interested parties more information on how to access these opportunities. Suker reminded that Croatia will have at its disposal 3,5 billion Euros, but it is up to the country to make sure that the funds are used through relevant projects. PRI funds are made available to future member states to support projects dealing with institution building, cross border co-operation, regional development, human resources and rural development. Minister Suker and also the chief of the EU delegation in Croatia Paul Vandoren said that when they say it is "up to Croatia" to use the funds, they are not referring just to the government but also the civil society and entrepreneurs, the Croatian business journal Banka reports. "Croatian entrepreneurs need to know how to participate in these projects through public tenders which will have the highest criteria," Vandoren said. He also urged the government to prepare the upcoming projects in order to access funds budgeted for 2012, reminding that the preparation of necessary documents can take a very long time.  Croatia will soon also have to define its developmental goals and strategic projects to be funded by the EU between 2014 and 2020. Starting in 2014 Croatia, will receive 1,6 billion Euros from the EU budget, plus an extra 670 million for agricultural development.
