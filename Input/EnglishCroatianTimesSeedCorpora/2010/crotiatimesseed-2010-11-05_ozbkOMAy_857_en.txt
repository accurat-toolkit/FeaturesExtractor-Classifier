A series of earthquakes across the Balkans that has sown some panic amongst Croatia's citizens is far from abnormal, Seismological Services of Croatia claim. The total number of earthquakes in the region is within the average range, the chief of the centre Vlado Kuk told the Croatian daily Jutarnji List. Some 2,100 earthquakes were registered in Croatia up until October 1 of this year. The recent earthquakes began in the night between Tuesday and Wednesday in Serbia when a 5.4 Richter-scale magnitude quake shook Kraljevo.  Two people died in what was the strongest earthquake to have hit the country since 1998. Similar magnitude quakes were registered in Turkey and Greece on the same night. The tremors spread to Croatia on Wednesday afternoon with a 3.2 magnitude quake hitting Zagreb area. Croatia is located in a seismically active region, in what is known as the Mediterranean-Trans-Asian belt. The parts of the country most susceptible to quakes are the coastal areas, with the south facing the greatest danger. The biggest magnitude that might hit Croatia (7.5 on Richter) could happen in the southern Adriatic. Such strong earthquakes had been registered there in the past.  In 1667 in Dubrovnik one such quake killed several thousand people. In continental Croatia, the most seismically active region is the northwest area around the Medvednica mountain. The biggest magnitude that could hit Zagreb is estimated at 6.5. Such event could kill as many as 3,000 people and destroy 22 per cent of residential areas. The strongest quake in Croatia in the last decade was registered on February 5, 2007 near Dreznica and had measured 4.9 on Richter scale.
