Croatia could have serious demographic problems in 50 years time if the current trend in population growth continues, data from the Central Bureau of Statistics show. The number of people in Croatia is declining year on year. Last year the country had 4.429 million inhabitants, 13,000 fewer than in 2005. Should the trend in low birth rates and prolonged lifespans continue, in 50 years time Croatia could have more pensioners than the working population, the daily Jutarnji List writes. The statistical Croat gives birth to 1.4 children. In order to maintain the current population levels that number should be at least 2.1 The average Croatian citizen is 41.1 years old or seven years older than in 1971. The number of people over 65 makes up a fifth of the population. The number of children below 14 is decreasing every year and currently makes up only 14 per cent of the total. Thanks to advances in medicine and easier lifestyles, the average lifespan is increasing. In 2009 women were expected to live to the age of 80 on average and men to 73 - 15 years longer than in the middle of the last century. At the same time, every year more people are born than die. The aging index, or the ratio of those over 60 to those below 19, is troubling, reports the paper. While in 1971 the index was 47.2 per cent it has jumped to 107 in the last  few years. For women it is 130, which means that in Croatia there are currently 30 per cent more women older than 60 than there are those younger than 19. Only six out of the 21 counties experienced a population growth but that was just 0.62 percent. By 2051 the country could have 715,000 fewer residents than today, demographers warn.
