Croatian President Ivo Josipovic apologized today (Wed) in Sarajevo for Croatia's involvement in trying to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s. In front of Bosnian parliament representatives Josipovic expressed his condolences for the victims of the war. He said that tomorrow he will visit Ahmici village, where the entire Bosnian Muslim population was massacred, and Krizancevo selo where Croat civilians were killed. "Only with right and justice can we rid our people of evil and mutual blaming, and assure that it does not repeat itself," Josipovic said, reminding that "the politicians of the 90s, out of ignorance, malice or insanity, believed that the solution for Bosnia was its division. So they planted a seed of evil and the feuding nations reaped death, war and destruction." In Bosnia, Josipovic added, these politics ripped apart the tissue of a unique society that was founded on multi-ethnicity. "I deeply regret that Croatia, with its politics in the 90s, contributed to that. I deeply regret that these politics contributed to the deaths of people and divisions that still haunt us." But the Chairman of the Council of Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina Nikola Spiric criticized Josipovic for not visiting any sites where Serbs were killed during the war, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List reports. Josipovic added that Croatia is particularly interested in the success of constitutional changes in Bosnia because it has an obligation towards Croats that still live there, although their numbers were halved during the war. The President will spend two days in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After Sarajevo he will visit Ahmici, Vitez and Krizancevo village, and finish his stay in Mostar.
