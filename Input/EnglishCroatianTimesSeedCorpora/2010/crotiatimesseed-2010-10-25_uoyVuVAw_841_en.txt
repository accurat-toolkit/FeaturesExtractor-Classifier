Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said her government is stable, and is confident that nothing will change that. Kosor's statement came after former PM Ivo Sanader said he returned to politics because of the "astonishing development of undemocratic events that started to occur after his leave". Sanader returned to policy as independent Croatian Parliament member on Friday. Commenting on the former PM's allegations, Kosor said yesterday (Sun): "If the fight against corruption and criminality is an undemocratic process than it is clear someone wants to stop that. Now, please stop asking me any more about those who left, they belong to the past and now the government has more important issues to worry about." Croatian media and politicians report Sanader is a serious threat to Kosor, because he could gather other HDZ members around him . By doing that Sanader could shake HDZ's stability in Croatian Parliament. The controversial former PM -abruptly left his position before the expiration of his mandate in 2009. Sanader never explained why he left, and many still speculate about his reasons. Also, he is no longer a member of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) as he was expelled in January. Croatian Parliament vice president Vladimir Seks, HDZ member said on Saturday in Split: "When runaway ex PM Sanader left the government his plan was to operate from the shadows. He wanted to rule without any responsibility, but the HDZ refused to allow him that. Now he has returned, but the HDZ is not afraid of him." The main opposition party in Croatia (SDP) believes Kosor and her party HDZ are not any more in a position to rule the government, and they have asked Parliament members to discuss this issue on Wednesday. It will be interesting to see how former PM Ivo Sanader, will stand in the debate, for or against Kosor.
