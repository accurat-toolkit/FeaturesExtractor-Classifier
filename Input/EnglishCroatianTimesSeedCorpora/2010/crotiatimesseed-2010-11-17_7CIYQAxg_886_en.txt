The government's proposal for next year's budget includes cuts for the Croatian Employment Services (HZZ) despite experts predicting a dramatic rise in the numbers of unemployed in 2011. The 2011 budget proposes a six per cent decrease in funds allotted for HZZ and eight per cent cuts for social welfare. According to the proposal, HZZ would spend 124 million kunas (16.7 million Euros) less next year than it did in 2010. Such expections are unrealistic, experts warn, as unemployment is expected to climb next year up to 330,000 or 340,000. The Institute for Public Finance has warned that the state budgets for the previous 11 years were equally unrealistic and had to be rebalanced - some of them several times during the year. Currently, 70,000 Croatians receive unemployment benefits. Last year's budget allotted 1.5 billion kunas (203 million Euros) for these services, while this year the amount grew to 2.04 billion (276 million) despite the government's efforts to curb the spending through lower payouts. The next year's budget proposes 1.92 billion kunas (260 million Euros) even though the country could be facing record unemployment rates. European Union funds are expected to compensate for part of the deficit, although the majority of those funds will become available once Croatia becomes a full member. The Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor together with the head of the Delegation of the European Commission to the Republic Paul Vandoren, gave 18 contracts worth 2 million Euros to non-governmental and governmental organizations supporting the employment of women. Only 51 per cent of working age women in Croatia are currently employed.
