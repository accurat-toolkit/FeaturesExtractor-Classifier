Either the dairy factories will raise the buying price of milk or producers will start spilling it on the streets, the representatives of the country's milk manufacturers have announced. They are demanding a purchasing price increase from the current 2.40 kunas (0.33 Euros) to three kunas (0.41 Euros) per litre. Igor Resetar from the Croatian Association of Milk Producers says that the dairy companies are not responding to the dramatic situation in domestic production that is declining significantly. In the last nine months alone it fell by 50 million litres, the daily Vecernji List writes. Instead of undertaking measures to help Croatia's producers, the firms want to import 80 million litres of raw milk, Resetar says.  "Considering that there isn't enough milk either in the EU or its surroundings, it is clear that the raw milk will be imported from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, where they do not need to follow EU norms or have adequate control in the labs," says Resetar, who gives the dairy firms three days to organize an urgent meeting and find a solution to the dairy crisis. In addition to the drop in production, Resetar says that the number of producers has fallen drastically from 27,556 three years ago to just 17,469 this past August. Fodder prices have in the meantime gone up by more than 100 per cent, increasing the cost of production per litre to four kunas (0.54 Euros). Even when state subsidies are included in the calculation, the producer gets 3.50 kunas (0.48 Euros) at the most. At the same time, the price of milk in stores has increased by between 80 lipas (0.10 Euros) and one kuna (0.14 Euros), the daily writes.
