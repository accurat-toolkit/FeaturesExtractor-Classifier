Support for Croatian President Ivo Josipovic has grown among Croatia's public despite his controversial speech on the country's role in the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The monthly CRODemoscop survey by Promocija Plus agency shows the president's popularity climbed from 39.8 per cent in April to 42.2 per cent this month making him Croatia's most popular political figure. Jadranka Kosor is second favourite with 9.5 per cent of those surveyed considering her the most positive politician.  Her popularity has suffered a drop of almost ten percent since the beginning of the year (in January 21.5 per cent of those surveyed considered her the most positive). Former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader remains the most negative politician in the country according to the poll. In terms of what Croatians find the most important issues, crisis tops the list with 31.9 per cent of those surveyed naming it as their most important topic. The government's programme for economic recovery was of concern for 18.9 per cent of those surveyed, and the publication of the Homeland War Veterans Register is the most important issue for 15.9 per cent of those surveyed. President Josipovic's speech in Bosnia and Herzegovina in which he apologized for Croatia's role in the war was the most important topic for 13.6 percent. Increases in the price of electricity, gas, and heating received a notable amount of attention at 8.11 per cent. Support for the government's work also fell in the last month from 46.7 to 35.1 percent.  The presentation of the government's economic recovery plan which includes some harsh measures may have influenced this month's opinion, the Croatian news portal Index writes.
