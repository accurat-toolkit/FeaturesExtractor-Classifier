Croatia is one of the three countries with the lowest rate of employment in Europe, with only 56 out of 100 eligible workers employed. Croatia's employment rate fell 1.2 per cent in 2009, from 57.8 per cent to 56.6, solidifying the country's unenviable position. Only Hungary and Malta are worse with 55 employees per 100 of working-age population (15 to 64 years). Croatian Employment Services (HZZ) analyst Darko Oracic says that Croatia is facing a so-called "discouraged workers" phenomenon.  Many of its unemployed are not looking for a job because they believe that they cannot find one or are hoping to return to their previous positions. Women fared somewhat better than men in this latest drop in unemployment both on the European level and in Croatia. Oracic sees the decrease in construction and industrial activity as the main reasons behind the trend considering that these sectors traditionally hire more male workers. In the manufacturing industry, for example, the employment decreased 9.5 per cent or 2 per cent more than the EU average. Eurostat data shows that those employed in education make up 5.7 per cent of the total workforce (2.5 of male and 9.8 per cent female). The education sector's share is seven per cent on the EU level. A similar trend is noted in health and social services - only 5.6 per cent of Croatia's employed work in this sector compared to 9.6 per cent in EU 27.  In Germany, for example, 11 per cent of all employed work in health and social services. Croatia's construction industry has 9.3 per cent share of the employed (the EU average is 8.4 per cent, the biggest in Spain - 12 per cent, and the lowest in Netherlands at six per cent). The share of employed in trade of 15.1 per cent is only slightly higher than the EU average led by Greece and Cyprus with 18 per cent.  The hospitality industry hires 5.6 of the total workforce, which is above the EU average of 4.2 per cent.
