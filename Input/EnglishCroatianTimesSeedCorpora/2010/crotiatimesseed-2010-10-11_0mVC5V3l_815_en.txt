Although prices of real estate have been falling for months, further drops are needed in order to kick start the sector's recovery, experts say. Apartment prices in Croatia are continuously falling, but apparently not enough for sales to take off. The average asking price for real estate in Croatia in September was 1.2 per cent lower than in August, or 5.3 per cent lower compared to last year. The average price of apartments in Zagreb in September was 1,818 Euros per square meter, which is 0.9 per cent less than the previous month or 4.7 per cent less compared to September 2009. The real estate prices in some Zagreb neighbourhoods are 20 to 30 per cent lower than last year. "The only way to balance the market is to have a decrease in prices, and consequently a drop in investments in construction. When the stock of apartments is sold out, a new investment cycle will begin," says Josip Tica from the Faculty of Economics in Zagreb. It is estimated that there are more than 10,000 unsold new apartments in Zagreb alone. Croatia's construction sector is in deep trouble, with 26.1 per cent fewer apartments finished last year compared to 2008, the latest data from the Central Bureau of Statistics shows. There were 8,434 buildings completed, which is 15 per cent fewer than the previous year. From January to July of 2010, construction companies with 20 or more employees finished 1,900 apartments, which is 54.2 per cent fewer than the same period in 2009. Rudolf Rom from the Croatian Chamber of Economy says that in order to overcome the catastrophic trends it is necessary to start-up investments in public and private sectors and to strengthen construction exports. He adds that the public sector must ensure funds for projects and prioritize those with quicker returns. Private sector also needs to have access to better loan conditions, the daily Vecernji List writes.
