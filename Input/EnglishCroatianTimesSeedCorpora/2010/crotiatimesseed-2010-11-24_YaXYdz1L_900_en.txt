The Croatian government and unions have agreed to hold a referendum on referendum regulations at the same time that the country votes for or against European Union membership. The Croatians will be asked whether they are in favour of changing the current procedures, which require 10 per cent of the electorate's signatures (450,000) in order to call a referendum. The new proposal lowers the requirement to 200,000 signatures and extends the time in which these can be collected from 15 to 30 days. The current rigid rules make it almost impossible to call a referendum, the daily Jutarnji List writes. Croatia has had only one in the last 20 years, when it voted for its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Earlier this year, the labour union representatives had collected over 700,000 signatures in support of a referendum on the government-proposed changes to labour laws, which they said would jeopardize worker's rights. The government has since retracted its proposal, making the referendum unnecessary. Nevertheless, there was a public debate over whether the referendum should be held in order to give the citizens an opportunity to exercise their rights. The union representatives, however, seemed satisfied with the outcome of this meeting with the government.  "We showed clearly that we had accomplished our goal with the fact that the government had retracted its proposal about changes to the labour laws," the president of the Union of Autonomous Trade Unions (SSSH) Mladen Novosel said. At the same time the unions wish to enable Croatia's citizens to have their will be known on various questions by facilitating an easier referendum procedure. The Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said that she hopes that the unions will lend their support to Croatia's European Union membership. The government is likely to need the unions' support as the latest polls show fewer Croatians favouring accession, the daily writes.
