Inspired by a sick video of the Bosnian girl laughing as she throws puppies into a river, a second video again by Bosnian kids where a cat is doused in petrol and set alight has been published on the internet. In the video, the animal is seen pinned against the wall in a wood as one of the boys strikes a match engulfing the cat from head to tail in a huge fireball. The terrified cat then dashes left and right leaving a 1 foot trail of flames behind it as the children laugh hilariously at the doomed pet. At the end of the video the cat jumps over a wall and disappears into the woods. The group of boys were identified as coming from the village of Misi in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina, news website Sarajevo-x reported. Animal rights groups said the fact that the other Bosnian teenager who chucked the puppies into the river had escaped any form of punishment and likewise her parents had not been sanctioned had encouraged other Bosnian kids to film acts of cruelty and publish them on the web. A Bosnian police spokesman said: "She was too young to be punished". Angry animal rights campaigners PETA in Germany said: "Unless something is done to set an example then this sort of thing will only get worse." The original 44 second YouTube clip of the puppies being thrown into the river shocked hundreds of thousands around the world. In the horrific footage some of the black and white pups could be heard whimpering in a basket before crying pitifully as they were flung through the air. At one point the girl, wearing a red hoodie, shouted "Wooo!" as she hurled them into the river one by one.
