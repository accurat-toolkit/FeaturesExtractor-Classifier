It's the bizarre beauty contest where nervous judges are likely to get an offer they can't refuse - Miss Mafia 2010. Contestants for the pageant in Budapest, Hungary, must either have mob connections or convictions for crimes that have earned them time behind bars. And at semi finals on Wednesday judges chose these four Mafia molls for next month's grand final. Stunner Alexa Diamond - a PA to a Hungarian mafia boss and serving three years on probation - said: "Here. it is only your beauty that counts and your record doesn't count against you for once." And curvy stripper Beata Kalman - who impressed the judges with a flash of her criminal undie-world - said: "I'm glad to get through but the party could have been better. "I know, I deal with drugs and party organisers all the time." Ruthless Clara Daak - who has done time for property fraud - told judges she wouldn't be seeking world peace or helping children if she won the title. "My hobby is collecting property leases from losers," she said. And porn star Aletta Ocean - who pleaded guilty to indecency in a public place - added: "I know I could never stay good long enough for a straight beauty contest so this is perfect for me." Now organisers are to ask their "spiritual inspiration" Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to become the patron after setting up a Facebook vote on who should lead them. Promotor Zsolt Kopasz - who dreamed up the event - laughed: "Silvio is the head of the one and only legalised mafia country - Italy. He has sent enough money and expressed enough interest in our quest so we have decided to name him as our number one supporter." Now the winner of the finals -- who gets a car and an apartment in Budapest -- will go on to the Miss Mafia Universe contest with an international showdown hosted by Japan's feared Yakuza.
