The European Union's economy is expected to grow 1.8 per cent, while Croatia's will shrink by just as much, the latest predictions show. That is good news for both with early EU estimates increasing from one per cent, while Croatia's estimated drop has been lowered from 2.4 per cent compared to initial predictions. Europe's recovery is headed by Germany whose GDP is expected to grow 3.4 per cent compared to earlier estimates of just 1.2.  The entire Eurozone is expecting a growth of 1.7 per cent (from earlier 0.9). Significant growth is also expected in Poland, or 3.4 per cent. Germany's recovery, however, will have little direct effect on Croatia, said chief analyst of Hypo-Alpe Adria Bank (HAAB) Hrvoje Stojic. "Croatia's share in German imports has been stagnating for a longer period and it has a tendency to drop, while countries like the Czech Republic and Slovakia have increased their share," Stojic said. He added that Croatia has already reaped the advantages of Germany's recovery in terms of its good tourist season. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, German visitors had the greatest share in the total of overnight stays or 19.8 per cent of 29.22 million. In its last prediction HAAB lowered the expected drop in GDP for Croatia from 2.4 per cent to 1.8, attributed to a tourist season that turned out better than expected. Stojic is reluctant to give in to optimism, however, considering the bleak state of the manufacturing industry. As far as the EU is concerned, a slowing down of growth is expected in the second half of the year, a part of a global trend, the portal Business writes.
