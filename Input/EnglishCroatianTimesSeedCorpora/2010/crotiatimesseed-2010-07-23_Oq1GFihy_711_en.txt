A park warden has been caught after pretending his park that used to be a British cemetery was still in use - and selling off plots of land. The English Cemetery in Naples was closed for burials late in the 19th century and most of its graves were transferred to another location when the local British Consulate gave the area to the city to turn it into a park in the 1950s. But some of the gravestones remained, which enabled the warden to make dozens of unsuspecting people believe it was still in use. Police found out about the fraud when a funeral company contacted the British Consulate in Naples about moving a body to the cemetery after a client told them he had bought a plot there. The 52-year-old warden who sensed the game was up took flight, leaving a note saying he had carried out the crimes because he was badly in debt with loan sharks and that he intended to commit suicide. Police soon tracked him down and he confessed to conning 28 people, although prosecutors believe there could be more. The man, who has been suspended from his job, had reportedly been seen with bruises on his face recently, which investigators suspect were the result of one of his victims taking justice into their own hands. The site of the English Cemetery, which is near the central Piazza Garibaldi, was bought by the city's British Consulate in 1826 for Protestants who died in Naples, although people of other religions ended up there as well. Among the people of note to be buried there in the 19th century were Scottish mathematician Mary Somerville, Irish science writer Dionysius Lardner, Dutch painter Anton Sminck van Pitloo and German Botanist Friedrich Dehnhardt, the director of Naples' Botanical Gardens.
