Zagreb Electric Tram (ZET) company has sent a cry for help to the city's mayor in hope that he will bail out the ailing public transport service. In their letter to Milan Bandic, the company's parent firm Zagreb Holding warns that they will soon no longer be able to continue with operation. "As the life in a metropolis is unimaginable without public transportation, we ask you once again to help us," they write. This is the first time that the public transporter has admitted the extent of the dire situation it faces, the daily Jutarnji List writes. The problem is that the City has not honoured its agreement with Zagreb Holding to subsidize ZET for part of the cost of its services.  These subsidies should amount to approximately one billion kunas (135 million Euros) per year, but the city has paid only 710 million (96 million Euros). At the moment Zagreb owes ZET 890 million kunas (120 million Euros). If the City were to pay what it owes, ZET would operate at profit instead of potentially losing close half a billion kunas (67.5 million Euros) this year. The company's officials say that Zagreb's mayor Bandic has refused to communicate regarding the payment discrepancies and that they are considering taking the City to court. ZET anticipates receiving 1.02 billion kunas (162 million Euros) of revenues next year, with the planned expenses reaching 1.45 billion (195.5 million Euros). Should the financial troubles continue, the public transporter's future looks bleak with the possibility of workers protesting over unpaid salaries and the company having to suspend lines throughout the city.
