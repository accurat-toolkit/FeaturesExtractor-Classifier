The European Union is expected to open its three remaining negotiation chapters by the end of the month. According to reports, Hague Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz's presentation yesterday (Mon) to foreign ministers of the EU in Luxemburg on Croatia's cooperation with the Hague Tribunal will suffice for the opening of the Judiciary and Fundamental Rights chapter. Croatia fulfilled the European Commissions' guidelines for opening this chapter a year-and-a-half ago, but the process has since been blocked by some EU states after Brammertz's dissatisfaction with Croatia's cooperation over access to certain military documents. Some EU sources say that the final version of the European Union's negotiating position on this chapter will be ready next week. In the version it gave to member sates, the European Commission has suggested numerous conditions for closing the chapter, but the discussion over Croatia's cooperation with the Hague continues. The Netherlands will allow opening of the chapter only if it receives assurance that the cooperation with the Hague Tribunal will be one of the conditions for closing the chapter, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. Among other important conditions are judiciary reforms and the processing of high-level corruption cases. The Spanish presidency believes that by the end of its mandate on 30 June, all three chapters will be opened and some others closed, which would give Croatia's negotiations a big boost. It would be realistic to expect then that Croatia would close the negotiations at the beginning of next year and sign the accession agreement before the end of the Hungarian mandate. In question are chapters on Competition Policy, Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, and Foreign Security and Defence Policy.
