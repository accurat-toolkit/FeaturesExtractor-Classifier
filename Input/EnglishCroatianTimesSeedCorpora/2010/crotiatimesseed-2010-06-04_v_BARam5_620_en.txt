A four-year-old girl dubbed Two-Face by her playmates has had the second of two operations to save her from a lifetime of torment after her mum begged medics for help. Half of little Tan-Jia's face was covered with a huge dark birthmark while the other half was completely normal. "It has been very hard for her because other children can be so cruel and call her names. To make it worse, she has a twin brother who was born completely normal. "They used to call her Two Face from the Batman film and some said she had been touched by evil," explained mum Shan Tan from Heilongjiang, northern China, who has to shave hair from her daughter's birthmark twice a month. Now the youngster has begun a series of facial reconstruction operations to remove the birthmark in sections and replace it with skin grafts from her tummy - with the second of three operations now complete. Surgeons at Xinqiao Hospital, in Chongqing, central China, agreed to carry out the ops for free after desperate Shan Tan contacted them about her daughter's plight. Dr Lei Lang explained: "It's very rare to see such a large and severe birthmark, but the patient can be cured through transplants of her own skin. "After two phases of surgery, she will no longer have a birthmark on her face. "Although she is a twin she and her brother developed from different embryos and we believe she has been suffering from a genetic mutation of her pigment cells." Now mum Shan Tan hopes her daughter's nightmare will soon be over. "I was reading her a fairytale about the ugly duckling and she asked me if she was an ugly duckling because everybody said she was ugly and laughed at her. It broke my heart. "Now she has a chance to be normal," she said.
