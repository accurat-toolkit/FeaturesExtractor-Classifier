Star biathlon athlete Jakov Fak, who won bronze for Croatia at the Vancouver Olympics this year, will have to decide by the end of April whether he will switch to the Slovenian national team. Since Croatia does not have sufficient conditions for serious biathlon training, Fak has been training in Slovenia. But after his win in Vancouver, the star athlete will have to decide whether he will take Slovenian citizenship. If he does not, the Slovenes will no longer let him train with them. "He cost us a medal," his coach, Uros Velepec said.  "Not me personally, but Slovenia." "I doubt that Croats will be able to persuade him to stay but if that happens, our team cannot let him continue training with us," Velepec said. According to a verbal agreement, Fak was supposed to become a "free agent" after the Vancouver Olympics, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reports. The director of the Croatian Olympic Committee Zlatko Matesa has promised Fak a 300,000 kunas (41,000 Euros) salary, but whether Croatia will establish conditions for serious training remains to me seen. Before going to Vancouver, Fak, who at the time already had a bronze medal from the 2009 Biathlon World Championship in South Korea, said that his life situation changed little after his success. "I am still living off my parents," he said. "I would at least like to make a living with biathlon." The Director of the Slovenian Biathlon Team Borut Nunar said that they had done their part. "It is up to Jakov to make the decision. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes, but he should know that he is welcome here." "But only as a Slovene," he added.
