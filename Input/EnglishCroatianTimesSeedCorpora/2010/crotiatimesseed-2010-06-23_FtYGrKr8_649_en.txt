A cat has baffled animal experts after trekking 2,000 miles across Russia to find his family after they moved home. Caring owner Ravila Hairova, 52, thought her grey moggie Karim would find a change of address too upsetting when the family moved from their home in Gulistan, in Uzbekistan, to Liska, Russia. So she arranged for her neighbours to take him in and even left his favourite chair, cushion and food bowls behind. But she was astonished when two years later she found a bedraggled, starving Karim - who'd crossed three state borders - waiting for her on her way to work near her new home. "I knew he had disappeared from my neighbours' home a few days after we left which was very sad but we never heard another word about him. "Then I was walking along the road and I saw this cat which seemed to be waiting for me. When I go closer I saw it was Karim - thin, and in very poor condition but it was him," explained Ravila. Now nine-year-old Karim, named after Uzbek president Islam Karimov, is like the cat who got the cream as he settles into his new home. "He is very happy now and so are we. I've no idea how he found us but I'm very glad he did," said Ravila. And Ravila's husband Lev Kondratyev (46) said: "We called to see how Karim was the day after we arrived and our neighbours told us that he had run off - we then called every day for weeks hoping for news and gradually we gave up hope. "He looks like he used up all of his nine lives to get to us - but it's definitely him. There are certain marks on his body including a scar on his tail when it was caught in the door that show us he is 100 per cent our Karim - and he obviously recognised us as well."
