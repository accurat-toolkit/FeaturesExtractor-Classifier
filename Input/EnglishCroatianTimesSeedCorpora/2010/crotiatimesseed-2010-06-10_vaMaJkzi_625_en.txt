A Spanish company has denied having an interest in building the LNG terminal near Ploce in southern Croatia. "We would like to let you know that our company absolutely denies having any interest in this project", it says in a letter sent to the Croatian Times from the Spanish company Gas Natural Fenosa. The denial has arrived after Croatian media suggested earlier this week that Gas Natural from Spain and National Oil Company from Iran were planning to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal for central Europe near Rogotin in southern Dalmatia. The project is allegedly expected to cost 700 million Euros, and the two companies would enter after the formation of a group including Berber from Zagreb, a company that specializes in business project development, it has been earlier reported. The location of the terminal would be two kilometres of airway from the port of Ploce. It would be built on a 25 hectares of land currently owned by the Vebecot company. Berber officials have concluded a chain of conversations in Iran and Spain and have invited the Croatian energy companies Hrvatska Elektroprivreda (HEP) and Plinacro to join the project.  It has been suggested that the Gas Natural would be the holder of the investment, while the Iranian company as a co-investor would guarantee the supply. The Iranian government has unofficially confirmed its interest to participate in the financing of the project and ensure the needed quantities of LNG starting in 2015, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. Djuro Popijac, the Croatian Minister of the Economy has given his support to energy projects that are "economically and environmentally viable." A study of the potential environmental impacts and the project's compliance with the regional plan will be commissioned due to the size of the undertaking.
