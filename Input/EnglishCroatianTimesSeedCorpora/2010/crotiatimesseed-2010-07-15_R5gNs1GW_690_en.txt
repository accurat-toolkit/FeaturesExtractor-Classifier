Austrian Social Democratic (SP ) Chancellor Werner Faymann's office announced today (Weds) the chancellor asked Kosor to attend a performance in the picturesque city as he met her for talks in Zagreb earlier this week. Austrian President Heinz Fischer is also expected to see at least one performance in Salzburg this year.

This year's edition is set to take place between 25 July and 30 August, featuring dozens of classical music concerts as well as opera and theatre performances. "Dynasty" star Joan Collins and tennis legend Boris Becker attended last year's festival. All eyes will be on Burgtheater star Nicholas Ofczarek who succeeds Peter Simonischek as "Jedermann" in the famous play by Hugo von Hoffmansthal of the same name. Simonischek has been playing the leading role in the famous piece since 2002, Austrian Times has reported. Faymann meanwhile stressed Croatia, which is holding talks with European Union (EU) officials to become a member in the next few years, must increase its efforts in fighting corruption in the country. "The legal system must be adapted to EU standards. I've heard many complaints by Austrian businessmen," he said. The chancellor however also said he was convinced both Croatia and Austria will make a full recovery after the global economic crisis. Austrian firms invested more in Croatia than businesses from any other country in the first quarter of this year, according to the Croatian National Bank (HNB). HNB said Austrian companies spent 195.8 million Euros, adding that Germany was in second (90.4 million Euros) and the Netherlands in third (70.2 million Euros).
