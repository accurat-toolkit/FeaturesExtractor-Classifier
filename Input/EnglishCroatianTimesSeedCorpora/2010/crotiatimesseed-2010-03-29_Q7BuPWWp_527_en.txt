The Croatian government has pledged 46 million kunas (6,336,000 Euros) to help haulers buy 639 new trucks with higher ecological standards that will comply with European Union (EU) regulations. At least 1,500 Croatian trucks will not be able to drive on EU roads starting in October 2011 because their emissions will not be up to EU standards. The subsidies are meant to help truck companies replace the old vehicles with new ones that would cut emissions by 30 times, reaching the Euro-5 level of emission standards. Marijan Barelli of the Association of Croatian Road Hauliers (HCP) warned today (Mon) that the number of transport companies had shrunk from 13,000 to 7,000 in the last three years. Of those 7,000 companies, only 2,500 are active in international transport. They have around 7,000 trucks in operation, of which 1,500 will no longer comply with EU standards in 2011. The Croatian Energy Efficiency Fund will provide 50,000 to 70,000 kunas for new eco-friendly vehicles, and it is expected that 639 trucks will be replaced. The others will be able to continue operating if they comply with the Euro 3 or the Euro 4 level but will have to pay double tolls. Barelli also said that, since international transport was regulated by agreements, a truck that was allowed to go through Slovenia could be potentially fined between 17,000 and 30,000 Euros if it entered Austria. Only 28 percent of the rolling stock in Croatia was less than 10 years old, State Secretary for the Transport Drazen Breglec said. The average age is 11 years for trucks and 13 years for buses. With those statistics, it would be difficult for Croatian haulers to withstand competition, Breglec warned.
