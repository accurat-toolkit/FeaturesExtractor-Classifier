The European Union has financed a new project worth 900,00 Euros aimed at raising Croatian public's awareness against corruption. The project - Strengthening inter-agency cooperation in the fight against corruption Campaign to raise awareness - will last until 2012. The campaign will include TV and radio spots, media announcements, flyers, billboards, internet banners, brochures and round-table discussions with various state and local bodies as well as non-governemnt organisations. It will also feature workshops for journalists. According to the EU survey done as part of the project, around 50 per cent of Croatian citizens believe Politicians are most prone to corruption. Forty percent think that judges are also a source of corruption, while 20 per cent thinks policemen are the most corrupt. The Head of the Delegation of the European Commission to the Republic of Croatia Paul Vandoren said that citizens fear corruption comes from those who should be protecting them from it. He said that the European Union expects Croatia to continue its fight against corruption with this initiative which should include all state institutions as well as non-governmental organisations. Better statistics are expected in terms of convictions in cases of corruption that should be made quickly and efficiently. The investigative bodies should work better, Vandoren added, and the confiscation of property should be carried out consistently and effectively. Regulation of the financing for political parties is also an issue. The perception of the level of corruption has improved since 2007 when 17 per cent of Croatia's citizens believed there was no cure against it. Today, only five per cent are pessimistic. But 70 per cent think that more rigorous punishments and a more rigorous laws are needed in order to prevent corruption in the future.
