Around 10,000 people on the Homeland War Veterans Register were neither in nor worked in services directly connected to the war, Zoran Komar from the Ministry of Veterans confirmed at yesterday's (Tue) roundtable discussion in Zagreb. Registered as non-combatants, they nonetheless receive the same status as war veterans to take advantage of car import benefits, Komar explained.  The status also gives them privileged pensions and shares in the veteran's fund administered by Erste Invest, although they never saw front line action. Part of the controversial Homeland War Veterans Register was leaked on the internet last week, causing uproar amongst the public and in the media. The government has refused to publish the register despite the urging of President Ivo Josipovic as it believes by doing so could compromise both the privacy and safety of many veterans. Others want full disclosure to avoid benefit scams. "The reason behind such initiative is not because [those that published it] want to straighten things out. It is because they want to divide the people and show the veterans as a burden to our society," Komar said. The advisor to the Croatian Prime Minister Sandra Svaljek said that the state gives approximately five billion kunas (689 million Euros) towards veterans' pensions. Although some had expected that she would mention pension cuts, she said that a delicate issue like that will need to be properly discussed, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reports. "It needs to be a sober discussion supported by analysis because we are talking about an economically and socially vulnerable population."
