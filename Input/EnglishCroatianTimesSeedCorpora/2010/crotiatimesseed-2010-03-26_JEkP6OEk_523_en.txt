Incest monster Josef Fritzl is secretly planning to call for a retrial of his case, it has emerged. Austrian magazine News reports that the 75-year-old pervert has been meeting lawyers and reading thousands of pages of court notes on his case to look for legal loopholes. Fritzl was jailed for life after admitting to rape, incest, murder and enslavement last year. He kept his own daughter Elisabeth in a home-made dungeon under the family home in Amstetten for 24 years where she was forced to bear him seven children. At the time of his trial Friztl pleaded guilty to all the charges, including the murder of a baby boy whose body he callously tossed into an incinerator. Fritzl - who'd planned to dispute some of the charges - told judge Andrea Humer that his daughter's heartbreaking videotape evidence was his reason for changing his mind. Now News magazine reports that Fritzl has made a spectacular U-turn in talks with his legal team. "I allowed them to drag me to the guillotine like a sheep," confided the cellar beast. Fritzl plans to find medical evidence he was not guilty of the death of the baby boy he had already admitted to killing. The magazine reports Fritzl is optimistic over his chances of a retrial and has started writing long letters to his ex-wife Rosemarie about a "wonderful future" they could have together. Criminal psychologist Adelheid Kastner - who told judges at the trial Fritzl was sane when he kept his daughter as a sex slave - claimed in a recent interview he was "no murderer in the classical sense". She said: "Fritzl accepted the death of one of his children, but he was probably not able to deliberately plan the death of a human. He did not cross this border as he regarded it as a taboo not to be breached."
