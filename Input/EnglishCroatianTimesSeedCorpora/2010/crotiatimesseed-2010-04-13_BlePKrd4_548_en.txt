The Neo-Nazi mastermind behind the theft of the sign above the entrance to Auschwitz death camp is being quizzed by Polish police today (Tuesday) after extradition from Sweden. Polish prosecutors said yesterday (Monday) they had begun questioning Anders Hogstrom over his involvement in the theft of the "Arbeit Macht Frei" sign. Hogstrom has denied plotting to steal the sign - which translates as "Work Will Set You Free" - prosecution spokeswoman Boguslawa Marcinkowsk said in Krakow. "The interrogation will continue until late Monday night and probably also on Tuesday," she added. Hogstrom, 34, is expected to be quizzed over an alleged British 'Mr Big' who ordered the theft from the UK. He was arrested in Stockholm on February 11 and has been charged in Poland with conspiracy to steal the sign that has come to represent the horrors of Nazi Germany. Polish police recovered the 16 foot metal sign on December 20, two days after it was stolen. They arrested and charged five Polish men. On March 11, a Stockholm court approved Hogstrom's extradition to Poland to face trial. In 1994, Hogstrom founded the National Socialist Front, a Swedish neo-Nazi movement he headed for five years before quitting. He told Swedish media he was only a middle man for the sign claiming he'd tipped off Polish police about the plot. The sign, which had been cut into three parts, was returned by investigators to the Auschwitz museum on January 21, less than a week before commemorations for the 65th anniversary of the camp's liberation by Soviet troops. Polish judicial authorities indicted Hogstrom in January and issued an arrest warrant for him on February 2.
