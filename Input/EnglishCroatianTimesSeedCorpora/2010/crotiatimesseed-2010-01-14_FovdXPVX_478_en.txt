By Thomas Hochwarter Rapid Vienna coach Peter Pacult has warned his squad to show the right attitude in the second half of the Bundesliga season as the contracts of eight players will expire in summer. "Everyone needs to act professionally. There is no place at Rapid for players who only show some extra effort to get a new contract or for players who don't do so as they will be leaving the club anyway," he said to Austrian Kurier newspaper today (Thurs). Pacult may also be referring to Nikica Jelavic as the Croat striker is reportedly being targeted by Hamburger SV and other top clubs. Pacult - a former 1860 Munich striker - admitted recently he would not be surprised if the 24-year-old left this winter. "He is playing at a constantly high level and has scored nine goals in Europe. This is something scouts of clubs with interest in him do notice, of course," he said. Jelavic - who joined Rapid from Belgian side Zulte Waregem in 2008 - underwent cervical spine surgery to ease neck pains he had been suffering for weeks in Zagreb last month. He is currently regarded as the club's most coveted player. While Rapid could cash in on around three million Euros by selling Jelavic this winter, the contracts of eight key players, including captain Steffen Hofmann, run out next summer. German Hofmann, who is linked to Real Mallorca and British Premiership clubs, would be on a free transfer this summer if Rapid bosses fail to reach agreement on extending his contract. Hannes Eder, Branko Boskovic, J rgen Patocka, Rene Gartler, Markus Katzer, Helge Payer and Raimund Hedl are in the same situation. But coach Pacult - who recently said he planned to extent his own contract with the club - said he would regard the situation realistically. "Football has become a fast-moving business," he said today. The Austrian Bundesliga - led by Rapid ahead of Red Bull Salzburg - resumes play on 12 February when LASK Linz host the leaders.
