The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) expelled former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader yesterday (Tues). HDZ leader and Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said Sanader had harmed the party at his unexpected Sunday press conference. Sanader had gathered some HDZ members and held a special press conference without previously having informed Kosor about it. Sanader, who resigned in June 2009, announced he had decided to return to politics at the press conference and said he was going to be fully active in his role of Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) honorary president. At the same time, he criticised Kosor, claiming she was not a good HDZ leader. In response, Kosor called an HDZ presidency meeting that lasted for nine hours yesterday and announced to the media at its end that Sanader had been expelled from the party. She described Sanader's comments as an attempt to undermine the government. At least 16 presidency members voted against Sanader, three voted for him, and two abstained. Kosor said: "No one can leave and then attempt to govern, but Sanader wanted to do so. Sanader's press conference was an unseemly benchmark that caused great anxiety in the party. We will not tolerate behaviour that endangers the HDZ or the government. We cannot afford an early general election because it would put a halt to many important initiatives, including EU accession negotiations." Kosor added that HDZ members at the Sunday press conference had been tricked because they did not know what about its subject would be. Sanader told Hina news agency he would accept the HDZ's decision. President Stjepan Mesic. Mesic said it was a logical move after Sanader's press confence. Mesic added that Luka Bebic, the head of Parliament who supports Sanader, should resign because he had helped him. Mesic agrees with Kosor that an early general election would not be a good decision at this time.
