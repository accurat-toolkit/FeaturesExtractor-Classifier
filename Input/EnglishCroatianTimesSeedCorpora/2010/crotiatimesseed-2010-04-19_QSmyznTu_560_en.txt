Troubled soccer star Dimitar Berbatov is facing claims that he romped with a second former Playboy model while his girlfriend was pregnant. The 30 million GBP Manchester United striker has been accused of dating stunning blonde TV presenter Simona Paranova last summer while his lover Elena Shtilianova was expecting their daughter Dea. Local media in Bulgaria say the couple rekindled an earlier fling while Berbatov was in Sofia visiting family, mutual friends told local magazine Weekend. When Simona was linked the star 18 months ago and asked about a fling she refused to deny it and hinted that it might be true. 'Did I have an intimate relationship with Berba? You can only find the answer to this question by reading between the lines," she said. And when asked if she'd also had flings with former Man City striker Valeri Bojinov and Bulgarian national star Blagoy Georgiev, she smiled and said: "I want them all." Now friends say the couple restarted the fling while Berba was facing the pressure of fatherhood. Simona is currently dating Bulgarian FA chief Borislav Mihailov which has led local sports commentators to say the rivalry could be behind his poor performance for the national squad. Some teammates have accused him of not giving 100 per cent for the squad because he'd rather play for Manchester United. But at Old Trafford Sir Alex Ferguson is said to want to sell Berba because of his poor performance. Berbatov was previously accused of cheating on Elena with Playboy model Daniela Arnaut who blew the whistle on their fling. "I was in love with him. He made me feel like a princess. He's well mannered and a real gentleman. "We had a unique relationship," said Elena.
