Colombian drug traffickers used chocolate Santas to smuggle liquefied cocaine into Britain, customs officials confirmed today (wednesday). The chocs' contents were picked up by security staff at Gatwick airport who had been scanning luggage for liquid explosives, said Italian police who arrested members of the 1,000,000 GBP smuggling gang in Milan. Investigators followed the trail of the dodgy liqueurs - worth 300,000 GBP - back to Bogata and Alassio in Italy where Colombian national Mariano Venturini was masterminding the scam. The cocaine was stashed inside Brazilian-made Santa chocolates made by sweet manufacturers Serenada de Amor, or the Song of Love, which became the police codename for the sting. Investigators also seized a cocaine-packed sweets parcel at nearby Linate airport and another box was tracked down at Colombia's Bogota airport. "This was clearly not the first time this gang had carried this out. Between us we intercepted around 1 million GBP of cocaine in one hit. "We believe they were doing this on a daily basis and millions of pounds worth of cocaine must have come through this same pipeline before we cut it off," said one customs official. "This was a very disciplined investigation carried out across three different countries which shows how far you have to go to stop these people. "And they would have continued to get away with it if the higher anti-terror alerts hadn't meant that all liquids - even liqueur Santas - come under suspicion," they added. A Dominican-born man - Luis Armando Rossi, 32 - was also arrested by Italian police who confiscated one way plane tickets to Colombia, thousands in cash and firearms in the raids. Both men have been remanded in custody where they are refusing to answer questions, say police.
