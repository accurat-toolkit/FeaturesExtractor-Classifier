Media mogul Bodo Hombach has allayed doubts about his satisfaction with his company's performance in Croatia after announcing the withdrawal of his WAZ Media Group from Serbia and possible other states in the region. The Managing Director of one of the biggest media concerns, Hombach said the company was not planning any changes in the way it runs its business in Croatia where it is a co-owner of Europapress Holding (EPH), the country's biggest newspaper and magazine publisher. In a recent interview with the German daily Handelsblatt, Hombach confirmed the company's intention to leave Serbian and Romanian markets, and several other countries in Southeastern European if necessary. Hombach said market inequalities and political abuse of power were the main reasons behind the company's decision. "In some countries there is no fair market competition. The tight connection between oligarchs and political power is poisoning the market," he said, adding: "This is not in reference to Croatia." Hombach and other representatives of German companies in Southeastern Europe said these barriers were not present on Croatian markets where the business climate and investment conditions have been improving as the country heads towards European Union accession. WAZ has encountered the biggest problems in Serbia where Hombach has been blackmailed by certain well-connected tycoons, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. WAZ is one of the largest newspaper and magazine publishers with a presence throughout Europe including Germany, Austria and Hungary. It is one of the biggest media investors in Southeastern Europe where it is an owner and co-owner of newspapers and publishers in Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia and Serbia.
