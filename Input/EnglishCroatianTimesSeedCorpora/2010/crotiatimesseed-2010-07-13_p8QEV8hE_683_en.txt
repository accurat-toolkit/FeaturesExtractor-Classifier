German sex swap pop sensation Kim Petras was in the spotlight this week as body ambassador for a new fashion label. Kim - who became the world's youngest ever gender swap patient aged just 12 - teamed up with German designer Lennart Wronkovitz to launch his new collection in Berlin. Born a boy Kim - seen here wearing Lennart's hand painted design - shot to fame last year with a series of raunchy singles and videos. Now she's posing for a set of modelling pictures for the 17-year-old designer that will show off her curves and his clothes for his Wronko label. "I've done some modelling for him already and his clothes are really cool, new and modern," said Kim, from, Cologne, Germany. "They show that he's very creative and has his own ideas. All these patterns like flashes and shoulder pads and drastic colours and cuts. "His fashion is exactly what I'd choose privately as well as in public - they are absolutely my style. Extravagant but a little street wear at the same time. Arty and cool," she added. But both stars still have to fit their careers in with their schoolwork, revealed Kim. "Both of us don't have as much time for school as other people because we do projects on the side. I told him about my music, he told me how he started and stuff. It was super interesting," she explained. Kim has already modelled for one of Germany's lead hair salons but said: "I'm really looking forward to supporting the label." "It's amazing that Lennart in his age has already designed and made his own collection. "His dad is a doctor and he runs his studio from the surgery. He's a special, dedicated guy," she added. And Lennart explained: "I am delighted to be working with Kim." "She's this unique personality and that fits with my unique designs. She is really youthful, crazy and feminine. "She is also super self-confident and a personality that just shines. In addition she's really friendly and cool. I'm really looking forward to working with her."
