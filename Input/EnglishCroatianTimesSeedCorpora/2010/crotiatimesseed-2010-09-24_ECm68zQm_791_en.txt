A British holidaymaker was stabbed by a gypsy prostitute after getting into a row with her about money, according to police in Bulgaria.   The man identified as John Edward Lloyds, 62, had been on holiday in Bulgaria's Sunny Beach Black Sea resort when the incident happened.   Although his condition was initially described as serious, doctors at the Bourgas hospital now say he will survive although he will have to remain in hospital for some time. They said he needs to have at least two operations over the coming few days.   Doctors said Lloyds had stab wounds to his chest a millimetre away from his carotid artery and also in his back. A hospital spokesman added: "He's very lucky to be alive."   Police identified the prostitute as a 24-year-old gypsy woman named Grozdanka Vassileva.   They said that she was from Stara Zagora and was one of the many women that head to the holiday resort when the tourist season is going on to service foreign clients.   They identified her from the description given by the wounded Englishman. She was arrested earlier today.   She told police that she had agreed to spend an hour with the man at the villa which he had rented in the region after she met him at an Irish pub in the area.   The prostitute added that once she had arrived at the villa he had then asked her to stay for longer but refused to pay more money - and refused to allow her to leave.   She said she had grabbed the kitchen knife to protect herself and then run off.   The Englishman had apparently not called police himself but had contacted staff at the Euromed medical emergency clinic asking for treatment, and because of the seriousness of his injuries they had informed the police.
