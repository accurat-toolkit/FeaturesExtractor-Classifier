Sixty per cent of Croatian managers believe the climax of the financial crisis is still yet to come, research by the strategic consultancy house Roland Berger finds. Croatian managers are most pessimistic when it comes to exiting the recession.  Compared to their European colleagues who believe the crisis reached its climax at the end of last year, the majority of Croatian managers are convinced that this is yet to happen. They expect the recession to peak either at the end of this year or in 2011. The research was conducted among 50 small and medium-sized businesses from seven different industrial branches. According to those surveyed, the crisis is most responsible for decline in sales, decrease in investments and chronic problems with debt repayment. More than 60 per cent of managers estimated that the same problems will be evident in 2011. Vladimir Preveden from Roland Berger's Zagreb office said that of particular concern is that the majority of those surveyed have predicted further downsizing and a continued drop in consumption. The research also found that more than half of Croatian firms find it difficult to get capital through loans, with the greatest problems being high interest rates and harder conditions, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reports. "Insolvency hit 50 per cent of Croatian companies, and unfavourable credits are more pronounced in Croatia then in other countries," Preveden said. When it comes to fighting recession, two thirds of Croatian companies have reduced employee costs through employment and salary freeze, lowering of wages and downsizing. "Crisis is an opportunity for restructuring, and recovery is possible with entrance onto new markets. With that I mean first and foremost Romania, Russia, Turkey and Asia," Preveden added.
