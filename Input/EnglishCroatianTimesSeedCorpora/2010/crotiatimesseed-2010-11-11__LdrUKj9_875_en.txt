Good marketing should focus more on lifestyle as well as promote off-season travel, according to tips given at the London Travel Market fair to the Croatian Ministry of Tourism. At the Ministry's meeting with British tour operators, Tara Hawkins from Croatian Villas said that contrary to what most advertisements show, Croatia is more than a select few destinations such as Dubrovnik and the Kornati archipelago. Promo shots should feature people enjoying a cappuccino on the Split riviera or children eating ice creams.  A stronger promotion of Christmas and New Year travel is also necessary if the country wants to extend its tourist season, she said. Lifestyle is what sells a destination, she said. Good marketing is just a stone in the mosaic, and many of those present the fair have said that next year's tourist season will be rather "tricky." The tourist industry in Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, and many other countries is facing de-stimulating (and unprecedented) passenger tax while travellers' standards are not rising. The Croatian Minister of Tourism Damir Bajs said that there should be no fear of such measures coming to Croatia. "Our government has a policy of supportting tourism," Bajs said. A bigger threat to the success of 2011 is the possible increase in hotel prices. Encouraged by this year's good turnout, some are considering these measures. "I hope that will remain just empty talk. The increases on British market have cost us too much and we had a stagnation because of that for the past three years" said Marko Resetar, the director of Dubrovnik agency Elite Travel. The things are going well for the agency however. At this year's meeting the company managed to make partnerships with four more tour operators that had not previously worked in Croatia, the daily Vecernji List.
