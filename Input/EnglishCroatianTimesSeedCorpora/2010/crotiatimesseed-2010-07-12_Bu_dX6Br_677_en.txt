A court has sentenced Libyan immigrant Mohammed Game to 14 years in prison over a botched plot to blow up a military barracks in the northern Italian city of Milan last year. An accomplice, Egyptian immigrant Mahmud Koh, was jailed for four years over his role in the plot. A third defendant, Imbaeya Israfel, another Libyan, is due to be sentenced later this year. Game, 36 and an Italian soldier were injured in the failed attack on Milan's Santa Barbara barracks on 12 October last year. Game, Italy's first would-be suicide bomber, was blinded and lost part of a hand when his explosive load failed to detonate properly. The Italian soldier was lightly wounded. Judge Stefania Donadeo on Saturday ordered Game to pay damages provisionally set at 100,000 euros to the Italian state. Game was arrested after the blast and charged with attempting to carry out a massacre and carrying and making explosive devices. Game was reported to have exploded a home-made bomb hidden inside a toolbox at the entrance of the Santa Barbara barracks. He allegedly entered the courtyard of the barracks on foot, where he was confronted by a military guard. The rudimentary explosives were reportedly made of solid nitrate. The toolbox where Game reportedly hid the bomb was said to have contained two more kilogrammes of explosives, and only partially detonated. Had the entire load detonated, there would definitely have been deaths, investigators said. Game had also complied a 'dossier' containing information on Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and other government ministers, the Italian investigative weekly L'Espresso reported last November. Game's case renewed concern about the integration of immigrants to Italy. He had lived in Italy for many years, has an Italian partner and three children.
