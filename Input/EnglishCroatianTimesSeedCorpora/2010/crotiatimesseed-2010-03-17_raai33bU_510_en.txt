Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said today (Weds) that she wanted Croatian labour laws amended to allow employers more flexibility in the labour market. Kosor's announcement suggested that the government might accede to some of the 17 requests that the Croatian Employers Association (HUP) has presented in the past, among which is greater flexibility when it comes to hiring and firing. Another controversial issue is abolition of paid lunch breaks, which HUP says make the  work week 37,5 hours long rather than the standard 40. Ana Knezevic, the president of the Union of Autonomous Trade Unions in Croatia, said that the government must not take sides and that unions were prepared to discuss even sensitive issues like lunch breaks. She added, however, that paid lunches were available in countries with even shorter work-weeks, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reported. Employers would also like to see termination and severance pay regulations stricken from the law and in future governed by private contracts. If they remain in the law, employers want employees to become eligible for severance pay only after four years with the same company, rather than after two as is currently the case. Contract-based employment is another issue on the agenda. The unions argue that the current three-year limit is too long, and that its length leads to many employers extending contracts on a month-to-month basis, leaving workers without any security. "That can lead to psychological illness" Knezevic said. Eight out of 10 new employees are not hired on a permanent basis but on a contract basis. Employers say that is because of legal restrictions on the firing of permanent workers and claim that, if there was more flexibility, they would hire more permanent employees. The next meeting about amendment of labour laws will take place in April.
