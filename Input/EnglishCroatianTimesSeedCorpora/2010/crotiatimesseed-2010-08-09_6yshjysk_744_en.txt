Austria Vienna suffered their first defeat in Austrian Bundesliga after being unbeaten for 19 home matches in a row yesterday (Sun). The team of former defender Karl Daxbacher was surprisingly beaten 0-1 by Upper Austrian side SV Ried. Midfielder Peter Hackmair found the net in the 73rd minute. Ried - who are coached by Paul Gludovatz - now top the Austrian Bundesliga table. Newly-promoted Wacker Innsbruck are in second place after celebrating a 2-0 win against taillights Mattersburg on Saturday. LASK also still have zero points on their account after four matches. The side of Helmut Kraft were beaten 0-1 by Kapfenberg on Saturday. Champions Red Bull Salzburg are only in eighth place in the 10-team league. Their 4-2 victory against former leaders Magna Wiener Neustadt were their first three-pointer this season. Sturm Graz remain in fourth despite losing against 32-time league winners Rapid Vienna 0-2 yesterday. Ex-Sturm defender Mario Sonnleitner was sent off 10 minutes before Croat striker Nikica Jelavic scored the second goal of the match (81'). Former Mattersburg star J rgen Patocka netted the opener in the 39th minute. Rapid bosses are expected to hold further talks with Glasgow Rangers officials to determine Jelavic's future. The 24-year-old national team ace is unlikely to stay with Rapid beyond the summer transfer period after his value soared thanks to convincing performances in the Bundesliga and in the UEFA Europa League last season. Drawings for the final Europa League qualification knockout round have meanwhile revealed that Rapid face Aston Villa once more. Peter Pacult's squad forced the Premiership giants out of the event last season, Austrian Times has reported. The Austrian Bundesliga table after four rounds: SV Ried, 9 points Wacker Innsbruck, 7 Magna Wiener Neustadt, 7 Sturm Graz, 7 Austria Vienna, 7 Kapfenberg, 7 Rapid Vienna, 6 Red Bull Salzburg, 4 LASK Linz, 0 SV Mattersburg, 0
