Owners of cafes in Zagreb have already started complaining that the smoking ban that took effect on April 9th is reducing customers and affecting their business. The bad weather is not helping and some imaginative entrepreneurs are putting out heaters and blankets for their more daring customers who may want to sit outside. Many of these establishments could not afford to install the required ventilation systems in time, so it appears that Zagreb, at least in theory, is becoming a non-smoking oasis. Out of 14 cafes that are on the way from the main Ban Jelacic square to the British square down the street, only one has a smoking licence. The new law requires that all bars larger than 50 square meters have to have separate smoking and non-smoking areas and better ventilation systems. Bars smaller than 50 square meters can decide whether to allow smoking but will also need special ventilation systems if they do. Those that have managed to acquire the licence are rejoicing. The owner of cafe Kolding, Slaven Duplancic, says that his place has been full since the ban took effect. "Since we became a smoking establishment it is always full.  I noticed that more and more young people are coming in.  I am afraid we could lose some of the older non-smoking guests, but the traffic has increased significantly." The other cafe owners are hoping for sunny days that will bring full terraces.  They prefer not to think about what will happen in autumn, the Croatian daily Vecernji List writes. In the meantime, the smokers are making their own lists of smoker friendly cafes that are being published on Facebook.
