Zagreb will get a new zoo four times the size of the one currently in Maksimir park. The director of Zagreb's Zoo Davorka Maljkovic confirmed the decision in an exclusive interview with the Croatian daily Jutarnji List. The location, however, has not been disclosed although there is speculation that it the facility could be built on the shores of the Sava River. While the new zoo would be open to visitors, its main role would be preserving and raising endangered animals, an obligation Croatia has as a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). Maljkovic said that the current conditions in Zagreb's Zoo are far from ideal because the space is cramped. "The expansion of the current ZOO that has been talked about for years is out of the question because we would not solve the problem. That is why it has been decided that a subsidiary be built on a larger surface, where animals would have an opportunity to procreate." The new zoo will have elephants, giraffes, rhinos, wild cats and many other animals for which the current zoo does not have enough space. Every animal will have ten times as much space as Maksimir Zoo currently provides, and it is possible that the visitors would sightsee from trains in order to cover the kilometres of the park. Maksimir zoo will not close, but remain as a central location from which the new zoo will be administered. Such large investment could give credibility to the rumoured privatisation of the Zagreb zoo. The City may be looking for a private-public partnership in which a large amount of the investment would be financed by a private investor. The government, however, has not confirmed any such moves.
