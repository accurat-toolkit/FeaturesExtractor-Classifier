Police hunting a Death Wish dad who gunned down a judge and a women after they raped his daughter have issued new pictures showing what he could look like after changing his appearance while on the run in Britain. Drasius Kedys has been missing since he killed a senior judge and his accomplice six months ago when police in Lithuania ignored his pleas for help after the pair attacked his four year old daughter. The 37-year-old dad is believed to have fled to London after well-wishers in the capital's Lithuanian immigrant community offered to hide him. Now four new before and after pictures released by police in Spain - where he's also believed to have hidden for a while - show what he might look like now. Spanish police believe he may have been hiding out in the seaside resort Alicanta, a popular destination for British holidaymakers. The snaps show what Kedys might look like if he stopped shaving his head and started to grow a beard. Kedys has been on the run since October when he fled after gunning down judge Jonas Furmanavicius, 47, and Violeta Narusevicien , 29, after his daughter Deimantela accused them of raping her. "He had complained to police but they did nothing. He's an ordinary man accusing a judge. In the end he dealt out his own justice," said one family friend. Meanwhile, Kedys has become a cult hero among Lithuania's ordinary people, who say they are fed up with widespread corruption. Demonstrators carrying posters proclaiming him a "child protector" took to the streets of Lithuania's capital Vilnius and second city Kaunas in a show of support. And two Facebook pages dedicated to him have been inundated with hundreds of messages of approval, some from the UK offering him sanctuary in Britain. Mugs and T-shirts have gone on sale bearing the logo: "Drasius: Lone avenger".
