The motorcycle gang "Hells Angels" is spreading across Europe and could increase its presence in south-eastern countries and the Balkans, including Croatia. European Law Enforcement Agency (EUROPOL) has warned of the increasing danger of their expansion in these countries at the international seminar about motorcycle gangs held in Dubrovnik from October 5 through 7. The agency has established a new system of early detection of organized crime - SCAN -  which gives the authorities strategic reports about new threats. Using SCAN, the agency has recently discovered that the activities of Hells Angels and other motorcycle gangs are on the rise. The outlaw of motorcycle gangs(OMCGs) such as "Hells Angels" and "Bandidos" are already present throughout the European Union. Recently the motorcycle club "Hells Angels" (The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club -HAMC) has spread to eastern Europe. It is the leader in reckless speeding in south-eastern Europe, especially Turkey and Albania, the Croatian Ministry of Interior said. Some have linked the motorcyclists to the production and distribution of various drugs such as marijuana, methamphetamine and cocaine. The authorities fear that the  establishment of new alliances could enable these gangs to gain greater control over the drug trade through the south-eastern Europe or the so-called Balkan route. They say that the Hells Angels have established strong connections with local motorcycle gangs in Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and that they are also present in Turkey. Europol warns about the dangers of the potential territorial wars and has called for an international cooperation in containing them. Police officers from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania and Turkey, and leading European experts from Norway, Spain, Netherlands and Luxemburg were  present at the seminar, the portal Monitor writes.
