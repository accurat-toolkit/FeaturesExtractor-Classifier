Some 3,000 residents gathered yesterday (Tue) to protest at the construction of a residential-business centre in one of Zagreb's pedestrian zones near Cvjetni Trg (Flower square). The construction of the ramp for an underground garage envisioned for Varsavska Street (Varsavska Ulica) had already been blocked on Monday when activists dissembled the fence that was guarding the site and remained there overnight. Angry residents called on Zagreb's mayor Milan Bandic and the Minister of Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Construction Marina Matulovic Dropulic to resign during yesterday's protests. They are planning another protest for tomorrow, Thursday at 18:00 during which residents are asked to bring their suitcases so they can send a clear message to the authorities to "pack their bags." The protestors are planning to head towards the city government offices, visiting along the way the State Attorney Office's chief Mladen Bajic who has been holding off on prosecuting cases of public corruption since 2007, the activist say. Although yesterdays protest was supposed to take place in Varsavska Street, the police had blocked access with metal fences. Some 500 activists remained in the blocked off area, while the rest of the residents gathered at the beginning of the street. Some time later, the police removed the fence and let the residents pass, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List reports. Tomislav Tomasevic, the president of one of the organisers Green Action (Zelena Akcija) said he regrets that so many policemen were called in to guard a peaceful protest. Speaking from the podium in the blocked-off area, he said: "We feel that we are separated from you, as though we are in a Varsavska ghetto. But Varsavska Street is ours and we will not give it up."
