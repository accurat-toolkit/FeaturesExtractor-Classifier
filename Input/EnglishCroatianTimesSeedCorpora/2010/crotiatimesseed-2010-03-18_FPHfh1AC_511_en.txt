A decomposed body linked to the bizarre death of British mum Heather Barnett has been uncovered hidden in a remote Italian church, it emerged today (Thursday). Seamstress Ms Barnett, 48, was found dead in the bathroom of her flat in Bournemouth, Dorset, with her breasts cut off and placed beside her. Strands of hair - which forensic scientists say are not her own - were placed in her hand by the killer. Now Italian police have discovered the body of the girl linked to Ms Barnett by their relationships with Italian Danilo Revisto Elisa Claps went missing after meeting Revisto on a date in 1993. He was quizzed by police at the time but released after serving five months in jail for lying to police over his movements. Less than a decade later he married mum-of-two Ms Barnett in Britain. He was quizzed twice by Bournemouth police following her murder in 2002 but released without charge. Now British police are expected to ask for access to the remains of the Italian victim, whose body was discovered in the attic during building works at the Most Holy Trinity Church in Potenza. She is understood to have been positively identified from the remains and from personal objects found with her, reports Italy's national news agency Ansa. Her mother Filomena recognised a T-shirt, a pendant and a pair of blue sandals. Scientists will today (Thursday) carry out DNA tests on the remains. The Holy Trinity Church is the last place where Elisa was spotted the morning of her disappearance. Police will also look into her relationship with the former parish priest, a suspected paedophile who died last year, reports the agency. Ms Barnett's murder baffled cops and forensic scientists with the strands of hair placed in her hand by the killer. British and Italian police will now be looking for any similarities between the two murders.
