Crook Lu Han Lee, 32, did not stand a chance when he snatched a handbag in front of multi-millionaire businessman Wan Liu. Lee and Pal Jin Gau, 37, drove up on a motorbike alongside a woman and grabbed her handbag before speeding off at Dongguan in Guangdong province in China. But wealthy Liu who was standing outside his office with his son jumped into their chauffeur driven limousine and sped off after the robbers. They caught up with the motorbike-fleeing thieves after a 3 mile drive and Liu ordered his chauffeur - also a fully trained bodyguard and karate black belt - to catch the men. The chauffeur managed to collar Gau but the second robber, Lee, escaped by jumping into a river. Unperturbed Liu called the local airport and got the pilot of his private plane to fly over the river until he spotted the Crook - and then he ordered his private helicopter to pick him up so he could hover over the spot where the robber was trying to swim to freedom. Wealthy Liu, who is the vice chairman of the Changping chamber of commerce, said: "I asked the pilot of the plane to fly low - I thought that would make the man swim to the shore but he didn't. Then I called for the helicopter. I was hovering over him hoping that the downdraught would force him to swim back to the shore - but he was absolutely refusing to do so." In the end he called up staff on his private yacht that sped to the scene where crew managed to apprehend the exhausted robber by scrambling over the side and hauling him on board with ropes. Liu, who owns a chain of expensive hotels is well known in China for the large sums he donated to victims of the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. At the time he was pictured touring the area and also raised large sums of money from fellow businessmen as well to help the victims.
