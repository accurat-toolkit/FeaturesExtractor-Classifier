The Croatian Ministry of Defense (MORH) has approved the docking of American amphibious war ships in Split's northern port for a planned clean up that could pollute the area. The so-called "washdown" operation would involve unloading and cleaning of all of the equipment that has been in military actions, including tanks, helicopters and weapons. The Croatian daily Slobodna Dalmacija writes that such action could be potentially hazardous as it involves removal of sand and preservatives, which may contain radioactive particles of uranium oxide. American military uses armoured shells with depleted uranium, which explodes into microscopic carcinogenic fragments that line the equipment as dust. Darko Smolic, the assistant director of Luka d.d, the Split north port concessionaire, believes that such fears are unfounded.  He mentioned that the meeting that took place between MORH and American military representatives of July 27 was only a preliminary encounter, and that no final decisions have been made yet. The majority owner of Luka d.d. concessionaire is the Russian entrepreneur Dmitrij Zeleznjak and the daily speculates that all of the profits from the operation would go directly to him, leaving only the dirty sea to Croatia. The deputy mayor of Split Jure Sundov said that the City had not been consulted about the project. The Split-Dalmatia County also was not aware. The operation "washdown" would involve the decontamination of the equipment used in military actions. All arsenal would we washed and disinfected with either water or chemicals from dust, motor oil, and various lubricants and preservatives that are for equipment protection.
