Polish investigators into the presidential plane crash that killed 96 VIPs and crew have accused Russian officials of withholding recordings from the doomed flight's black box recorder. Military experts in Warsaw say 16 seconds of conversation are missing from the recordings and that Moscow has only allowed them access to a Russian-made copy and not the original, it emerged today (Wednesday). A Russian-prepared tape of the Tupolv military plane's approach to Smolensk airport in western Russia was released last month. It appeared to blame the pilot for the crash which killed Polish president Lech Kaczynski showing that he had ignored warnings to cancel his landing in heavy fog. Now Poland's head investigator Jerzy Miller- reports Polish news network TVN24 - are to quiz Russia over the "missing minutes" from the recordings and demand access to the original black box. The crash has opened up a widening rift of distrust between Poland and Russia with Warsaw officials accusing rescuers of looting bodies for security sensitive laptops and mobile phones. Then Kremlin officials were forced to deny authentic-looking footage of Russian soldiers apparently shooting survivors at the crash site. Meanwhile, four Russian soldiers charged with stealing credit cards from a victim of the crash have made a tearful apology. Under interrogation -  writes Russian magazine Zhizn - the soldiers promised to repay the family of historian Andrzej Przewoznik the 1,400 GBP they spent on his credit card gambling. The soldiers - now facing five years in prison - had been the first to arrive at the crash seen and had ignored survivors to loot bodies.
