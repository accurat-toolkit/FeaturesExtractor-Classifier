A Croat man is trying to track down a long lost nephew after his dying brother told him of a boy he had fathered during a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1967. Joseph Skalamera - who lives in Florida, USA, but whose parents come from Moscenicka Draga and the island of Krk - said that before passing away in 2006, his brother had asked him to find the boy, who would now be 43. "I served in Vietnam from 1966 to 1968 mostly in transportation support of front line troops. My brother, Anthony, had a boy there in 1967. He was a civilian who worked for the American government in Vietnam," Joseph told the Croatian Times. But during his search for his nephew, Joseph has found himself helping other Vietnamese-Amerasian families reunite. After contacting several Vietnamese-Amerasian groups for help they led him to the website 'Father - Founded' set up by Danish traveller Brian Hjort. "Brian asked me to help him in uniting other families as I searched for my nephew so I did and recently I had the honor and blessing of finding the American father of a Vietnamese-Amerasian woman. "He lives in Oregon and she lives in Arizona. They speak or email each other every day now. And I am very happy to have had the opportunity to have participated in this happy reunion of father and daughter. "At first they were very cautious because they thought I was a con-artist. But it has proved to be such a happy ending! Better than Hollywood because it is real," Joseph told the Croatian Times. But the search for his nephew still goes on. "I will keep on trying because as I have seen, happy endings can come true," he said.
