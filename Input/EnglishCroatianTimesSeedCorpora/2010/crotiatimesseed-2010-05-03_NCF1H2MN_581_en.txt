President Ivo Josipovic and members of the Croatian government commemorated yesterday (Sun) the 19th anniversary of the massacre in Borovo village in which 12 policemen were killed in 1991. They were the first collective victims of the Homeland War that was fought between 1991 and 1995, the Croatian daily Vecernji List has reported. No one has yet been charged with the killings. Association of Homeland War Special Police Vice President Stevo Culej said that the victims still yearned for justice and truth. "It is well-known who the guilty are because investigations were undertaken. We have been asking for justice for years, but the guilty are still walking free," Culej said. His brother was one of the policemen killed when Serbs ambushed a police bus that had arrived to rescue two colleagues who were allegedly being held hostage. Interior Minister Tomislav Karamarko said this week that the Ministry would start looking for ways to bring the murderers to justice. "The case of Borovo village is a paradox of contemporary Croatia. Twelve people were killed here in a bestial way, and we know who most of the perpetrators were. But they received amnesty under the Amnesty Law. It is paradoxical that this is not considered a war crime since civilians committed it," he said. In 1996, Croatia passed a law that grants amnesty "from criminal prosecution and criminal procedure to the perpetrators of criminal acts committed during aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflict and related to aggression, armed rebellion or armed conflict in the Republic of Croatia." Acts considered war crimes are not covered by the amnesty. Josipovic emphasized that reconciliation would be difficult if the perpetrators were not punished.
