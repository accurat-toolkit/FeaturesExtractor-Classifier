President Josipovic and Prime Minister Kosor are expected to broadcast a minute-long message to Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) to register and vote in the upcoming general elections in BH in order to best protect their interests. The two leaders will broadcast their call to all Bosnian Croats now living in Croatia to register by July 19 so they can vote in the elections scheduled for October 3. The message comes after Josipovic'e meeting earlier this year with the Prime Minister of one of BH's governing entities Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik.  Josipovic said that a large number of Croats from Republika Srpska no longer live in their homes and has emphasized the need to encourage their return. "Only a small number came back, and mutual plans for voter registration, encouragement of return and building of homes are big and important steps. I hope we will fulfil everything that we agreed to today," Josipovic said after meeting with Dodik. The number of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been shrinking by almost five per cent on a yearly basis, bringing the current numbers to 459,000, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. Since the situation is worst in Republika Srpska where only seven per cent of pre-war numbers remain, the leaders' message to register and vote is directed primarily toward former residents of this part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision to make a public plea comes out of Croatia's constitutional responsibility to take care of its citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Office of the President said in a statement. "That can best be achieved if they participate in the governing bodies, in other words, in the government. That way Croats can best protect their interests," the statement read.
