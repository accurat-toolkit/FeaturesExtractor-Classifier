At a closed session on Tuesday the Croatian government proposed constitutional amendments for sections that are relevant to the country's entrance into the European Union. With the approval of the Parliamentary Committee on the Constitution it also suggested the inclusion of all national minorities into the preamble and the provision for the removal of the statute of limitations for privatization-related crimes. Prime Minister Kosor said that these amendments would bring the country closer to finalizing EU negotiations which she hopes will happen by the end of the year.  Some analysts have suggested that this is unlikely, however, as three additional EU ascension chapters have not yet been opened. "If we do not start the procedures we will miss the deadlines," said Kosor warning about those coming up at the end of April.  "There is no reason for that and I believe that all of the political parties undoubtedly agree about Croatia's entering into the EU." The main opposition party Social Democratic Party (SDP) wants the constitutional changes to include the regulation of the voting in the diaspora, a change that the majority party Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has been avoiding as a significant number of their supporters are voters from Bosnia and Herzegovina, some analysts say. If SDP refuses to support the proposal, the government would not have the needed two thirds majority to push the changes through, the Croatian daily Vecernji List writes. "I can't believe that SDP would vote against Croatia's entrance into EU, against the end of negotiations and against the not having statute of limitations on privatization-related crimes. Those would really be strange messages," the Prime Minister said.
