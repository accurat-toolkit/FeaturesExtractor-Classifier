If Croatia does not cut the food and beverage value added tax (VAT) in tourism, the industry could collapse, the president of Tourism Business Council at Croatian Chamber of Commerce (HGK) Franco Palma has warned. "It is too late for this year, but the Minister of Tourism Damir Bajs should fight for the decrease of VAT to 10 per cent. Because of the crisis, tourists are spending less and that reflects on the tourism business results," Palma said. Hoteliers had asked for VAT decreases last years, but their requests had been refused. They are pushing again this year, forced by the reality that shows a significant drop in tourist consumption. Their renewed appeal comes at the time that Croatia is implementing tax reforms and tourist businesses believe that newly proposed property tax would aid their cause as it could provide compensation for income lost due to the VAT decreases. "People are not giving up on summer holidays, but it is obvious that because of the crisis they are spending less and that they are saving at every step.  That is why we need to encourage their consumption," Palma said. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, little  more than 916,000 tourists visited Croatia in the first four months of this year, or a 5.8 per cent decrease from the same period last year.  There were 2.5 million overnight stays, which is 4.5 per cent fewer than last year. The weather in May was not conducive to greater traffic and even the first two weeks of June do not raise hoteliers' confidence.  July, August and September are expected to be the same as last year. Palma estimates that Croatia will receive 10 to 15 per cent less revenue from tourism than last year.  As not much more can be done this year, hoteliers are already looking to 2011, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes.
