The former wife of the world's most famous terrorist Carlos the Jackal has told how he turned her off with his cheesy chat-up lines. Magdalena Kopp - who spent 13 years on the run with the Communist assassin - had revealed the intimate secrets of their life together in a new book. And she tells how the feared international hitman was a flop with women because he was clueless as a lover. Magdalena - now 62 and living in Neu-Ulm, Germany - says she first met the terrorist killer in 1975 after she became involved with extreme left wing politics in her homeland. "At first he began to chat me up really crudely," remembers Klopp in the book, 'The Terror Years - My Life by Carlos' Side.' "To be honest it was crass and I found him utterly repulsive," she added. In the new movie biopic of Carlos - real name Ilich Ramirez Sanchez - he's shown hitting on Magdalena saying: "Revolutionary discipline - are you willing to submit to it unconditionally?" The couple did not become lovers until 1979 when they met again in Hungary - and only because Carlos threatened her with a gun, she revealed in an interview with Germany's Express newspaper. "He put his gun on the bedside table next to my bed and slept with me and did what he wanted. It was almost rape," writes Magdalena. But she finally ended up falling for his ruthless streak. "He wore me down and I began to get impressed with the power and the ruthlessness he exuded," she explained. When Magdelena was captured during one botched assassination attempt, Carlos spent months trying to kill her to stop her talking and murdered 24 innocent victims trying to blow her up. But she says: "I was searching for love and recognition the whole time. But as I slowly began to see clearly who he really was I was already too deeply involved in the whole affair to be able to come out of it."
