Croatian President Ivo Josipovic and Serb head of state Boris Tadic said yesterday (Wed) in Opatija that they hoped that their mutual accusations of genocide could be settled outside the International Court of Justice. Croatia sued Serbia in 2008 for genocide during the war that took place between 1991 and 1995 in the former Yugoslavia. Serbia countered with a similar lawsuit last year, accusing Croatia of genocide against Serbs. "It would be good to resolve these questions outside the court," Tadic said. "That does not mean that we would give up prosecuting war criminals. Croatia and Serbia cannot be hostages of individuals. We are ready to work on a compromise that will provide a solution but that will not go against the principles of justice." The two presidents met yesterday in Opatija in what was their first bilateral meeting since Josipovic took office in January. Both confirmed they would have frequent meetings in the future as the two countries developed a new, European partnership, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List reported. Tadic commented that he was the first Serb tourist in Croatia this season and extended an invitation to his countrymen. "There is no doubt that Serb tourists are welcome in Croatia," Tadic said. "I also invite Croatians to come to Belgrade for a music festival," he added. The afternoon lunch-meeting concluded with both presidents joking that the only remaining question between the two countries was who would win the Davis Cup. Serb Novak Djokovic is currently ranked second by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), while Croat Marin Cilic is ranked 9th and Ivan Ljubicic 13th.
