As a consequence of the Greek crisis, the European Union (EU) will make the Euro introduction criteria for Croatia stricter, potentially pushing back the changing of the currency to 2017. Croatian EU negotiating circles warned that it is unlikely that Croatia's kuna will be replaced by the Euro two or three years after the country's entrance into the EU as it was expected. "We do not have any official information yet, but it is realistic to expect that what is happening in Greece will influence the further expansion of the Eurozone. No one wants a repetition of the Greek case," a confidential source told Croatian daily Jutarnji List. He does not believe that Maastricht Treaty criteria will change, but EU will delay Croatia's taking over the Euro by introducing stricter supervision of national statistics, and with an emphasis on healthy and sustainable economic foundations. That is how the EU initially blocked Bulgaria from access to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM-II), a "prep course" that requires countries entering the Eurozone to maintain the stability of their national currency for two years. It seems unlikely then that kuna will be replaced by the Euro by 2014 or 2015 as had been expected. The earliest date would be 2016 or 2017. Hrvoje Stojic, an analyst withHypo Bank says that consequences will be a slower adjustment of the Croatian economy to those of the Eurozone. "In such a situation, the fall in interest rates will slow down, so the public, companies and state will have more expensive loans than would have been the case with Euro," he said. He also warned about the importance of passing a Fiscal Responsibility Law that would establish the credibility of fiscal politics.
