Sixty three per cent of Croatian voters would say "yes" to accession to the European Union were the referendum to be held tomorrow. Such extensive support for EU membership has not yet been seen in the last seven years, the daily Vecernji List writes. These are the latest results from an investigation about the attitudes of citizens towards EU accession which was conducted in October by the Ipsos Puls agency, on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integrations. These exceptionally good results coincide with the closing of three chapters of negotiations - Free Movement of Capital, Transport Policy, and Institutions. The Head of the Delegation of the European Commission to the Republic of Croatia Paul Vandoren welcomed the results.  "Citizens are slowly realizing the advantage that joining the EU would bring them," he said, adding that he had warned of the importance of presenting the public with complete and detailed information about the accession. These positive results are credited to greater optimism as negotiations near the end and the informational activities intensify. The support of the Croatian political elite, including the country's President and Prime Minister, has also had influence on public opinion, the state secretary for European Integration Andrej Plenkovic has told the press. The support for EU is slightly higher amongst men (50 per cent compared to 46 per cent for women). Those with a higher level of education and university degrees are also more inclined towards EU membership. Geographically support is almost equal throughout Croatia - in north Croatia, Lika and Banovina as well as Primorje and Istria some 49 per cent of the population supports the accession, just one percentage point fewer than in Zagreb and the surrounding area. The lowest support can be found in Dalmatia (46 per cent) and Slavonia (45 per cent), the daily Vecernji List writes.
