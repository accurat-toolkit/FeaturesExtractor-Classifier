The Faculty of Traffic Sciences in Zagreb has suggested charging congestion fees for cars driving into the city centre. In Zagreb and the surrounding area, there are approximately 550,000 vehicles - a fourth of the country's total. The city, however, was not built to handle such a large number of vehicles and changing the urban infrastructure would be a long and costly process Marko Slavulj, a traffic engineer, said today (Fri). Slavulj added that the advantages of reducing traffic would include environmental benefits such as fewer exhaust gases and less noise, but such a measure would also give a boost to the public transport system that would be seen as a cheaper and more practical alternative to cars. But whether the plan becomes a reality depends on political opportunities and partners, Slavulj said. "This question could be resolved by a referendum, as was done in Copenhagen and Stockholm," he added. Copenhagen and Stockholm are European cities that have adopted congestion charges. Others include Rome, Bologna, Florance, London and Oslo, where the number of vehicles in morning and evening rush hours has been cut by 10 to15 percent. The Zagreb city centre is bordered by Kvaternik Square on the east, British Square on the west, the Central Railway Station on the south and Nika Graskovic street on the north.  The suggested daily fee would be 20 kunas or 2.75 Euros. The results of the investigation conducted by the Faculty of Traffic Sciences in collaboration with the city government will become part of an urban planning strategy called Zagreb-plan.  If the project is approved, it is unlikely that it will become a reality before 2013.
