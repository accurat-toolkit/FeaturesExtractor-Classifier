Polish anti-racist groups have called for Holocaust-denying historian David Irving to be banned from the country where he's holding a guided tour of Nazi death camps next week (Sept 27). Irving's 1,300 GBP-a-head tour will take in the notorious Teblinka camp and some of the darkest locations in Nazi occupied Poland, including Adolf Hitler's personal bunker and the Gestapo headquarters. Now Poland's Nigdy Wiecej - Never Again - group say he should be turned away from the boarder on arrival. In a joint statement with the anti-Nazi organisation Searchlight the group said: "We urge Polish and British authorities to react strongly and not allow this shameful visit which offends the memory of victims of the war and the Holocaust." "The group will mainly consist of Holocaust deniers and neo-Nazis from the UK and other Western Europe countries and the United States," the statement adds. Irving has been warned he and his group will be shadowed by Polish secret service agents when they arrive in Warsaw. The historian has previously accused Polish authorities of "Disneyfying" death camps as tourist attractions and building watchtowers at Auschwitz that were not there during World War II. "I have been a historian for 40 years. I know a fake when I see one. When you look at old photos of Auschwitz, those towers aren't in the photographs," he said. Irving was arrested and imprisoned in 2006 when he visited Austria, where Holocaust denial is a crime. Andrzej Arseniuk, spokesman for Poland's National Remembrance Institute  - which investigates and prosecutes Nazi and communist-era crimes - said that they will act if Irving publicly denies Nazi crimes.
