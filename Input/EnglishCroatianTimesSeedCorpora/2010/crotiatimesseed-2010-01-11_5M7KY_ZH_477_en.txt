The gay model who bedded both tragic Boyzone star Stephen Gately and his partner on the night he died has confessed to lying about his relationship with the couple. Student Georgi Dochev, 27, has always claimed he met the singer and partner Andy Cowles only hours before Stephen died of heart failure at his holiday home in Palma, Majorca. In an interview he sold to British media Dochev maintained he'd run across the pair while clubbing that night and went back to their villa to continue the party. But in an interview with radio station Darik FM in his native Bulgaria, Dochev admitted: "This is not true. We met more than two years before that night." Dochev now says he, Stephen and Andy regularly met for sex in the two years leading up to the tragedy. And when he was asked what went on during the dates, the smirking student said: "Well - we didn't go fishing or go to the library. I did it with both of them." Dochev gave a graphic account of how he, Stephen and Andy swapped partners before the Boyzone singer died face down on a sofa where all three of them had earlier had sex. "He was very,very drunk, and when he fell asleep on the sofa with his body in a weird position, it did not seem that strange to me. "We had a threesome on the sofa where Stephen died. Stephen and Andy slept together on the sofa, I fell asleep in the bedroom. "In the morning Andy went into his room. I noticed some strange spots on Stephen's legs, but I thought it was due to some kind of skin disease," said Dochev. "Then Andy and I had sex once again in his room. Then we had a shower, and went to Stephen. I took his wrist and he was motionless. I asked Andy to come and check him. Then we saw fluid coming out from his mouth," he added. Now Dochev says he's been dumped by his regular boyfriend because of the scandal. "I split with my boyfriend in the aftermath of these events. He told me that he was not breaking up with me because I was with Andy and Stephen, but I doubt that," he said.
