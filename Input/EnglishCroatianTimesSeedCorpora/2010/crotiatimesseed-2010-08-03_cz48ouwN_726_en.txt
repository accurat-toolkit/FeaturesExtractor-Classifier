Medical professionals and social workers have more time off for holidays, illness and maternity leave than any other sector, the Central Bureau of Statistics data for 2008 and 2009 shows. Croatian health professionals and social workers take off around two and half months per year on average while still getting paid. They also spend 38.5 working days on vacations or short sick leave, and 15.5 days on longer sick leave or maternity. In 2008, they worked 444 hours less than other workers but still got paid. At 1,636 hours per year, they work even less than teachers who receive fewer paid days per year. Although the statistics on the state level do not look favorably upon doctor's productivity, the medical professionals of Lika County stand out with their diligence - they have put in 1,933 hours, winning the title of the most hardworking employees in the country. They invested 30 more days of work than the average Croatian, and 38 days more than the average health care professional. The average Croatian employee spends 1,639 hours or 212 days per year in their jobs. They also spens an additional 393 paid hours on vacation or sick leave. This means the average worker spends every fifth day not working while being paid for it. On average, Croatian busy bees put in 32 overtime hours per year, although in reality a significant number of employees in private firms work longer overtime hours. Administrative professionals top the list of most eager overtime collectors, with 84 hours on average per year. Those in financial occupations put in the least, with seven on average. The most productive region is Dubrovnik-Neretva County whose residents worked 1,725 hours in 2008, 30 more than the Croatian average.  The laziest seem to be those in Virovitica-Podravina County (north-east) with only 1,669 hours worked, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes.
