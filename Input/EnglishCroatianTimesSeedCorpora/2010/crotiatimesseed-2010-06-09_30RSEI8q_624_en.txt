The Croatian singer Severina has confirmed her support for a referendum on Labour Law (ZOR) reforms by adding her signature to the petition that unions started today (Wed) in Zagreb. "I am here because of my parents since I also come from a working class family. I came to support all workers - mothers, who raise children with their hard work, and fathers who are taking care of their families." The petition began at nine o'clock this morning and will continue until June 23, midnight when unions must turn in 450,000 signatures. The organisers would go into every nook of the country in order to reach all of those who wish to put their signature on the petition, the union representatives said. After several days of uncertainty, the government and unions finally arranged for a weeklong negotiation period during which the new Labour Law proposal would not be included in the Croatian Parliament's agenda. In the meantime, unions are continuing with the referendum petition in order to strengthen their position at the negotiating table, the Croatian portal Business writes. The government's new proposal would limit the continuation of worker's rights established by the collective agreements to six months after the expiration or termination of the agreement. It would also enable the cancellation of all collective agreements made for definite or indefinite periods of time. Unions find both provisions unacceptable, saying that they would lead to the break down of the system of collective bargaining and would enable employers to cancel collective agreements en masse and establish unilateral labour regulations.
