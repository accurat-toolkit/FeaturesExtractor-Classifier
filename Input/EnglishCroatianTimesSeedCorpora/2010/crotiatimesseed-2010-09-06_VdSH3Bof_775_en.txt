The Queen's former banker will face a knight in the battle to keep open the Pilgrim's Way footpaths that inspired Chaucer's Canterbury Tales when a public enquiry reopens for the final hearing tomorrow (Tuesday). Sir Geoffrey Nice QC - war crimes prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic at the Hague - is no stranger to the international media spotlight and has lived in the Kent village at the heart of the row for three decades. Speaking yesterday at home he confirmed he had taken time off to make sure he could attend and added: "I want to detail what I have seen of usage of these paths by villagers over the past 30 years." Sir Geoffrey was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1990 and a Knight Bachelor in 2007 and his practice includes human rights public law and personal injury. The future of the ancient paths will finally be settled this week as the former royal investment banker Timothy Steel bids to close the footpaths across Kent woodlands near Adisham to the public. The inquiry will decide whether Mr Steel - former vice chairman of the Queen's investment bankers Cazenove - has the right to fence off parts of the ancient woodlands. Villagers from Adisham protested to Kent County Council (KCC) after three paths used by walkers and horse riders were closed off by Mr Steel, who put up padlocked metal gates and barbed wire and signs ordering them to keep out. Retired businessman and protest organiser David Leidig, 73, said: "I used to walk my dogs there almost every day, then suddenly there were gamekeepers driving around on quad bikes chasing people away." The villagers' appeal, which included more than 100 testimonies from people who had used the paths going back to 1927, was accepted by KCC last year after an eight-year battle. The council ordered the paths registered as a public right of way. But despite the decision, the gates have remained in place and a public enquiry was adjourned last month but will restart this week.
