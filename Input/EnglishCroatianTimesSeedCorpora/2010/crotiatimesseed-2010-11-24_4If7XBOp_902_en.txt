The Croatian industrial sector's production has dropped again after last month's slight growth raised hopes of recovery. After September's growth of 3.1 per cent, he sector experienced a 4.4 per cent year-on-year drop in October. The chief economist of Split Bank (Splitska Banka) Zdeslav Santic says that all industry categories - with an exception of the energy sector, which has benefited from colder weather in October - have seen a decrease in production. "We have few export-oriented sectors, the positive effect of the Eurozone on exports is very limited, and numerous companies continue to struggle with their problems," Santic said.  He adds that Croatian labour-intensive sectors such as textile and wood manufacturing cannot react quickly enough to adjust to the price drops demanded in times of crisis. Some 33,000 industrial jobs have been lost since September 2008. Just in the first nine months of this year, 14,500 people or 7.1 per cent of the sector's workforce has been dismissed. Only the construction sector is faring even wore - some 16,000 people lost their jobs in the first nine months of the year. That is 13.9 per cent of the workforce, the daily Jutarnji List writes. They are followed by the field of real estate brokerage in which 7.5 per cent of the employees have been dismissed from January through September. Industrial production fell 1.8 per cent in the first nine months of 2010. The latest World Bank's EU10 and Croatia report assessing the state of the new European Union members, warns that the "the lack of trust in the recovery is still present, which makes investors risk-averse." This lack of trust is reflected in the double digit drop of investments, the daily writes.
