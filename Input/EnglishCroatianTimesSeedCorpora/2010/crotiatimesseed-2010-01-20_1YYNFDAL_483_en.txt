By Thomas Hochwarter The first Viennese organisation for pensioners with a Croatian background has become a complete success after being established last year, the Austrian Times has reported. Set up last October, weekly meetings of the "Treca dob" (Third Stage of Life) community have been attended by 10 to 30 retired guest workers from Croatia, Wiener Hilfswerk spokeswoman Martina Goetz said today (Weds). "Health issues and exchanges of information about leisure time opportunities are the dominating topics," Goetz said while speaking to the Austrian Times today, adding that the community loved to sing traditional Croatian songs when they met at 7pm on Thursdays in rooms at Schottenfeldgasse 29 in Vienna-Neubau. "Every time, some of the group cook dinner, while others bring homemade desserts and delicacies," she explained. Goetz revealed "Treca dob" members spoke both Croatian and German when they gathered. "Most of them have lived in Vienna for more than 40 years, and many in the meantime have acquired Austrian citizenship, so this is a natural process," she said. Goetz said members of "Treca dob" were "well integrated" in Austria, but she also explained: "Some of them say Austria has reached its capacity in taking in migrants and refugees." The Wiener Hilfswerk spokeswoman told the Austrian Times it had not occurred to her that "Treca dob" members might feel they had been confronted with prejudices while living in Austria. "They have all been here for a long time and love living in Vienna. You can feel how much they enjoy living in a city with such high quality of life. Many of them have children and grandchildren who also live in Austria," she said. Goetz said "Treca dob" - an association that does not charge for membership - was already planning various day trips in the spring. "People interested in joining the community should simply come round to one of the weekly meetings," she said.
