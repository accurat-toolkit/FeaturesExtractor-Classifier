For the Romanian millionaire who built a real-size Southfork, at Slobozia, southern Romania, the Dallas dream is over long ago. Ilie Alexandru was sentenced to 12 years in jail in 2001 and was conditionally freed on 11 February 2009, for good behaviour. Ilie Alexandru was sentenced to jail for fraud after his company never delivered some 5,000 tones of "mustard plant" to a German buyer, although he had paid for it. Also, he took large loans from banks and was accused of other frauds with cereals - like wheat, barley. All his properties - including the Dallas complex in Slobozia - have been seized by banks and creditors. The Southfork ranch in Slobozia - copies at large scale, even 20 per cent larger than the ranch building in "Dallas" - including a zoo and a copy of the Tour Eiffel - was also visited by the actor who played J.R. Ewing - Larry Hagman, in 2000. The Southfork farm was also mentioned in the Armand Assante starring movie "California Dreamin'", by Romanian director Cristian Nemescu (2007), as they exotic place where the American soldier were taken to have fun. The movie was awarded the "Un certain regard" prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007. In an interview from jail, in 2005, for Academia Catavencu, Ilie Alexandru said : "I admired J.R., but I was like Bobby. The Bobby inside me finished me." He said he had "bags of money", and he was disappointed with Larry Hagman, when he saw him   at his ranch in Slobozia. After being released from jail, Ilie Alexandru has started a new business with cereals, according to media reports. The Dallas entertainment complex still exists - having new owners. The complex has several hotels and restaurants -under the name Hermes. One of the hotels is named "Dallas" and it offers accomodation for prices from 21 to 31 Euros/night.
