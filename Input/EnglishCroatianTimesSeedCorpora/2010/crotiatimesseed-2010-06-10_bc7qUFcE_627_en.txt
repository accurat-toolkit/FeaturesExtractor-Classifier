Germans are not content with being the best at muscling in on the sun lounges - now their dogs are getting in on the act as well. A dog hotel with an artificial beach by a German lake and sun lounges for every guest has been such a success that two other doggy hotels have now been opened as well." The pampered pooches enjoyed five-star luxury when not soaking up the sun on a sun lounge on the beach which includes a theatre for dogs and even a bus service to pick up the pets and bring them direct to the hotel. Katja Stephan, spokesperson of the "Paw Hotel" in Berlin, said: "We wanted to create a hotel for dogs whose owners are on vacation or just want some time off. "The dogs all get spacious rooms where classical music is played to them. "We offer a special pet theatre where owners can bring their pet and watch plays. "It works really well, we have not had any fights yet - all of our visitors are much more interested in the performances." "We also have Art exhibitions with works that we think will interest the pets." "The dog beach - specially created alongside a local lake, is complete with dog friendly beach chairs and sun chairs. "One important thing there is that the dogs are allowed to run freely without a leash on the premises. And they can bark to their heart's desire because we have no direct neighbours." Pets are ferried by a 40-seat Club-class shuttle bus cruiser from special bus stops. Each pet passenger has their own private window-seat booth with soft rugs, air conditioning and soothing piped classical music. "They are all in separate cabins so there's no chance of any fights breaking out," said bus boss Ute Seemann. There are branches of the "Paw Hotel" in Hilden and Jade in Germany.
