Croatia has managed to attract new tourists this summer despite the crisis, with 60 per cent of those surveyed by VISA credit card company confirming that they are in Croatia for the first time. That is a 13 per cent increase of first-time visitors from last year.  The remaining forty per cent have had pleasant experiences vacationing in Croatia in the past and have decided to come back, the survey shows. The majority of those surveyed (65 per cent) said that they made their own arrangements, while 35 per cent consulted and used the services of a travel agency.  Although the internet remains a leading source of information about Croatia, this year's survey shows a decrease in its usage.  Compared to 44 per cent last year, this year only 36 per cent of visitors said that they received the first information about where to go for vacation online. The research also showed an increase in TV commercial recognition. Fourteen per cent of those surveyed said that the first information they received about Croatia was via TV commercials (compared to only four per cent in 2009).  Six per cent were initially informed at tourism trade shows (eight per cent in 2009). Some 60 per cent use credit cards as a method of payment when traveling in Croatia. Only 30 per cent travel by car (32 per cent in 2009, and 43 in 2006) despite Croatia's well-developed road infrastructure.  Air travel remains the preferred mode of transportation, the Croatian portal Business writes. Upon arrival, the majority stays in private accommodation (39 per cent) or hotels (34 per cent). Around 46 per cent pay for their accommodation with a credit card. Only five per cent of visitors bring their own food, while the majority of tourists buy it in local stores (more than 35 per cent) or eat in restaurants and hotels (59 per cent).
