More than a third of patients have bought restricted medicine without a doctor's prescription, a new study of counterfeit drugs has revealed. The study - by Viagra makers Pfizer - says the illicit sales are worth more than 10 billion GBP a year throughout Europe. Most sales - 45 per cent - are for drugs to combat obesity, with flu and erectile disfunction reaching 35 and 25 per cent, shows the report. The study comes amid growing concern among medical officials who say fake drugs are often unsafe, inefficient or of poor quality. In December European industry commissioner Gunter Verheugen said the EU had seized 34 million fake tablets in just two months, a figure which "exceeded our worst fears." Italians and Germans are also thought to have spent the most on fake prescription-only medicines - an estimated  3.6 billion and  2.7 billion respectively. It comes amid growing concern over the issue among officials who say fake medicines are often unsafe, inefficient or of poor quality. In December, European industry commissioner Gunter Verheugen said the European Union had seized 34 million fake tablets in just two months, a figure which "exceeded our worst fears." An EU report from July last year claimed that many of the fake pharmaceuticals seized in 2008 came from India. But the World Health Organisation says it is hard to calculate the extent of counterfeiting of medicines. Research consultancy Nunwood questioned 14,000 people in 14 European countries online in November for the Pfizer research. The  10.5 billion figure was calculated based on the number of people buying prescription-only medication without a prescription, multiplied by the average annual spend per purchaser.
