Homeland war veteran and Hrvatska Kostajnica city administration employee blew up his office in what appears to be a protest against his wife's recent dismissal from the same institution. 42-year-old Tvrtko Sokler walked into the Hrvatska Kostajnica city administration building at around 4pm yesterday (Mon) with a hand grenade. A cleaning woman he ran into at the entrance first refused to leave but then fled when Sokler showed her the device. "Don't you see what I have in my hand?" he told the surprised woman. The Mayor of the town and an acquaintance of Sokler heard the muffled explosion as he was parking nearby. "When I saw our cleaning woman and she told me that a man went inside with a bomb in his hand, I thought the worst, that someone had killed themselves in the city administration's building.  My fear was even greater when I found out that it was Tvrtko Sokler, an employee and an acquaintance of mine," Paunovic said. The police arrived soon after and called out to Sokler, who was calm and composed as he left the building. He was unhurt since he had evacuated the office before setting off the bomb.  According to the witnesses, Sokler was under the influence of alcohol. Although the police are still investigating the motives, many speculate that the motivation for Sokler's act is the fact that his wife Dijana was laid off from her job at the same institution. "It is true, Dijana was fired, it is recession, we had to decrease the number of our employees but it is difficult for me to accept that Tvrtko would activate a bomb because of that," mayor Paunovic said. Sokler is the president of the city's Social Democratic Party (SDP) and had been elected to the city council in the previous elections. Since he could not hold both of his positions, he gave his seat to another councillor.  He is also a veteran of the 90s war, the daily Jutarnji List writes.
