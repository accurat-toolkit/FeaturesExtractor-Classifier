The expected 17-per-cent increase in electricity prices means that a family of four will be paying 170 kunas or 23 Euros more a month on average. Critics argue that the anticipated price increase will further undermine consumer purchasing power and delay the country's exit from recession. Whether the price will rise has not yet been confirmed although the National Electricity Company (HEP) has asked for an increase. Energy expert Davor Stern said that, although unavoidable, the price increase should be combined with a new payment model. "Electricity payments for a certain number of square metres should be subsidized, while the remaining excess square metres would have a different rate," he suggested. The price increase would further reduce the energy industry's competitiveness, Vladimir Ferdelji, the head of the firm Elektrokontakt that produces electro-installation materials, said.  "The decline in competitiveness will lead to a fall in production, more price increases and a new wave of job losses," he added. A family of four in Croatia pays an average of 1,000 kunas or 138 Euros a month for electricity. Average monthly earnings for half of the population are between 1,900 kunas (262 Euros) and 4,500 kunas (620 Euros). The price increase would add about 170 kunas or 23 Euros to their bill each month. Hrvoje Stojic, an analyst from Hypo Bank, said the increase would mostly affect people of modest means, the daily Jutarnji List reported. It is hoped that anticipated elimination of the two-per-cent crisis tax on incomes between 3,000 kunas (409 Euros) and 6,000 kunas (819 Euros) will stimulate consumption, but the savings from tax cuts will be eaten up by higher electricity bills, critics have warned. Electricity prices in Croatia are some of the lowest in Europe at 0,0935 Euro per KWh. Prices were lower last year only in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania.
