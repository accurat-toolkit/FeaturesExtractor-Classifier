A teenage schoolgirl will auction off her virginity live on Hungarian TV today (Thursday). The 17-year-old blonde who says she will be 18 when the meeting with the man takes place is opening the bidding on local TV channel Tabu in an attempt to raise cash to stop her family home from being repossessed. She has refused to give her real name and on her website goes by the name Miss Spring, and had originally tried to stage the auction on ebay before it was closed down. But several people did manage to keep in touch with her via e-mail and one even managed to agree a deal. But that was cancelled by the school girl when he added that he also wanted to marry her and continue the relationship after the first night. She said she had wanted to keep her identity a secret so her mum did not find out and simply give her the money afterwards, but she said that was too late now after her picture was published by local media. She said: "I am not complaining - my face being in the papers meant thousands of people have looked at my blog over the last few days. Hopefully they will take part in the bidding on Thursday." The original sale was closed down by auction website eBay after the bidding topped 100,000 GBP. The freckle-faced girl - who claims she has never had a boyfriend and lives in northern Hungary with her mother and baby brother - explained:" I don't think there is anything wrong with it. "It's just for one night. And I think it's actually quite romantic because the man who pays me this money will be helping to save my family from being homeless. He will be my saviour. "I broke off the deal with the British guy because he wanted to go too far. I'm not looking for a husband - I'm doing this for my family," she added.
