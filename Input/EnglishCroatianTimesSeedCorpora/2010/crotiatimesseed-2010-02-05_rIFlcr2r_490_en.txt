Mean Girls star Lindsay Lohan has been branded a "nutcase" by her billionaire host over her VIP demands at a high society ball. The troubled actress will be the guest of veteran Viennese playboy Richard Lugner next week (Feb 11) at the posh Opera Ball in Austria. But LiLo has fallen out with her host following a series of bad-tempered exchanges over her transport arrangements. First the star demanded a private jet to whisk her from Los Angeles to Vienna because she "just couldn't" take a scheduled flight. Then she rejected the 5 million eight-seater Learjet Lugner offered because it doesn't have a bed. "She refuses to take a scheduled flight and told me I must get a private jet sorted out for her," said bemused Lugner, 77. "But I haven't got a choice, I suppose - because she's a nutcase." The tycoon added "I managed to book an eight-seat jet, but she refused to accept it. She said it would be too uncomfortable and she would not be able to get any sleep when flying in it." And Lohan is set for a massive fall out with newly-married glamour girl Jordan, who's also attending the event. Lugner is trying to make sure the two women don't meet at the bash after the actress told him she did not want to meet Jordan, real name Katie Price. When asked if the two glamourous stars would meet Lugner confessed: :"I doubt that Lindsay wants that." Lugner has made an international name for himself inviting celebrities to attend the high society event. Other guests have included singer Grace Jones and actress Pamela Anderson are among his previous guests at the ball. Jordan is attending the ball as the guest of marketing millionaires Irene and Alexander Mayer, who met her through Elton John's AIDS charity.
