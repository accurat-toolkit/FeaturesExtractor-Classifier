Almost half of young Croatian women have some difficulties when it comes to sex, a nation-wide study has found. Forty seven per cent of women between 18 and 35 are suffering from some difficulty related to sex - either a lack of sexual desire, inability to experience an orgasm or painful intercourse. Although it is believed that elder women are more likely to suffer from sexual problems, the national study conducted in April on 1,000 young Croatians shows that every other woman has been faced with one or more sex-related issues in the past year. Most of the problems had lasted at least two months, the daily Jutarnji List writes. The averages show that most women had their first intercourse at the age of 18 and have had two sexual partners. Employed mothers are not more predisposed to problems than their unemployed counterparts or women without children. The assumption is that the women under 40 fulfil the role of a mother while still building their career and that this pressure could affect their sex lives. The most frequent drawback that women reported is the lack of a sexual desire, which grows with age. A lack of interest in sex is reported by every fifth girl between 18 to 23 and every third girl between 30 to 35. The inability to reach orgasm and pain during vaginal intercourse falls with age, although not significantly. Those problems are reported by 25 per cent of women in the younger age group, while in the more older group, 23 per cent of women report them. The authors of the studies warn that the frequent sexual problems with young women could be a consequence of the societal emphasis on sexual hyper-success, which affects younger women more. With older women, who know their bodies and have a more realistic picture about sexual life in general, the data could be significantly more positive. A recent research on sexual habits of Americans, for example, showed that women between 25 and 44 have many more difficulties than those older than 44.
