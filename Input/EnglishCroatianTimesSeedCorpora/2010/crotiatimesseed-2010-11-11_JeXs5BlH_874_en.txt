"We are on the way out of the recession," the Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor told those gathered at the recent summit of economists in Opatija. Speaking to her critics, the PM said the government's economic recovery programme is being implemented, contrary to rumours. "The only thing in which we were not successful were the changes of the labour laws," Kosor said. She added that the government is currently working on the 2011 budget, no small task considering that it would take to accommodate additional expenses while adhering to the pre-established three-year framework. Some of the additional costs that the government will have to account for are increased interests on debt, parliamentary elections and the referendum about Croatia's membership in the European Union. President of Croatia Ivo Josipovic said that the government must speed up the public sector and the local administration reforms regardless of upcoming elections. Kosor responded to the critique saying that decisions to eliminate certain counties, districts and cities cannot be made without political consensus. "I believe that we will finally manage to accomplish that," she added. And despite the presence of negative indicators, Josipovic believes that there is room for tempered optimism. "The most important thing is to be able to pay back our debt," he said. "For faster economic growth it is necessary to attract fresh investment capital and increase competitiveness," the President added. His greatest concern, however, is the continued growth of number of unemployed, which has reached 304,000, the daily Jutarnji List writes.
