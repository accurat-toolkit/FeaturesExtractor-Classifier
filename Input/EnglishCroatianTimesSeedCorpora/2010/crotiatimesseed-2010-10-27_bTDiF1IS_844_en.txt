The president of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso has avoided mentioning a concrete deadline to the end of Croatia's European Union negotiations, prompting some to believe that he was sending a message of caution. In a recent meeting with the Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, Barroso avoided mentioning any deadlines for the possible end of the negotiations or Croatia' accession to the European Union.  He said however, that what local media has described as caution is just a new standard procedure. According to new European Union politics, dates will no longer be set for anyone. The European Commission said last year that the negotiations could potentially end in the year 2010. It is clear, however, that this deadline will not be reached, replaced by the the vague prediction of sometime "during 2011." Barroso added, however, that the accession date can only be set once negotiations are finished. In his cautious and categorical statements that there is no date, Barroso wanted to send Croatia a message that it has not finished its job yet, the daily Jutarnji List writes.  The main obstacles that remain are the judicial system and the shipyards that have not yet been privatized. With its financing of the shipyards, Croatia is not only breaking the EU agreement but also its laws on market competition, the daily writes. The best case scenario will see the issues surrounding the judicial system resolved in the next few months. While Croatia has received accolades for its progress in de-politicization of the judicial system, Barroso's caution is a message that there is still work to be done.
