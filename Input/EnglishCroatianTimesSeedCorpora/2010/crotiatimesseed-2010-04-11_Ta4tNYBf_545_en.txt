Chinese Doctors have successfully completed a 20-hour operation in a bid to save the life of the Chinese Avatar girl whose illness left her looking like one of the creations from the 3D movie. Doctor Christine Zhan from the hospital in Lishui Zhejang, Southern China, said: "We successfully removed 90 percent of a tumour from her head and she is recovering well. She needs to build up strength again and we need to avoid any complications from further infection over the next few days before we can continue the operation. "But the first stage went well and despite the stitches has left her looking much more like the girl her parents knew rather than how she was recently." Twenty-two-year old Wu Xiaoyan has already woken up and been able to thank doctors for their work -  although she still needs to other major operations to remove the rest of the tumour - and the complete facial rebuilding work. Doctor Christine Zhan said: "She even managed a short smile." Wu had no medical insurance and her parents from a remote rural community had no chance of raising the estimated 17,000 pounds needed for treatment. However the hospital went ahead with the operation because of the urgency of the case with the parents promising to be responsible for the debt -- and after a substantial sum of money was raised by an appeal from the charity journalismwithoutborders.com. David Rogers from journalismwithoutborders.com said: "The total bill for the three operations will end up being around 20,000 pounds with the first operation alone costing 13,000 pounds. However the hospital itself has donated 3,000 pounds." If Wu continues to improve and also recovers so well after the next two operations doctors say there is a good chance that she will be eventually allowed home - although she will also need extensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the coming months.
