The government will appoint 50 commercial attaches by the end of the year who will help Croatian entrepreneurs do business abroad, the Minister of Economy Djuro Popijac has announced. "Fifty commercial attach s will be placed through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in those cities and countries that are of most interest for our economy" Popijac said at the opening of the 9th International Conference on Export Promotion organised by the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HBOR) yesterday (Thu) in Zagreb. Experts agreed that it is necessary to implement all 128 measures of the government's economic recovery programme in order to increase production and the competitiveness of the Croatian economy. They warned, however, that they are not being implemented as quickly as needed. "The slowest to be implemented are pension and labour market reforms," said Marko Skreb, main analyst for Privredna Banka Zagreb (PBZ). "While we are too slow to implement the reforms and are dropping on the competitiveness scales, the countries in the surrounding area are going ahead. We cannot have a government that is friendly both toward the employers and unions," he added. He expects Craotian GDP will be 1.4 per cent in plus next year, and a little over two per cent in 2012. "Future GDP growth will be lower compared to the period between 2000 and 2007 because it was based on big personal spending and state spending as well as imports. We can no loner have spending and investments as before because total debt has surpassed 100 per cent of GDP," Skreb said. "The only way out is in the growth of exports, and that we can achieve only with new approach and serious structural reforms," he warned.
