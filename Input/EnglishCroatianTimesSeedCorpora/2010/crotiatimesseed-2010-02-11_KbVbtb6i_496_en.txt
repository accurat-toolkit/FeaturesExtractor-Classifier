Trouble Mean Girls star Lindsay Lohan has pulled out of tonight's (Thurs) posh Opera Ball after she missed her flight. Lohan had demanded the scheduled BA flight be delayed and forced other passengers to wait two hours - but got off again when she was asked to pay 14,000 pounds for making the plane late. Veteran playboy Richard Lugner confirmed: "British Airways refused to let the actress take off until she paid a charge for delaying the flight from Los Angeles to London. "British Airways called me and asked me to pay the 14,000 GBP fee as the plane had to wait for two hours. But I haven't got unlimited credit so I said no. "She told me she wanted to pay as well, but she didn't have that much money available on her credit card. So she apparently got off the plane again," said multi-millionaire Lugner, 77. High-handed LiLo, 23, still on probation for cocaine charges in the US, had first demanded a private flight for the trip and then rejected a nine seater Lear jet as too small for her to sleep in. "I haven't got a choice, I suppose, since she's a nutcase," said Lugner, who has previously accompanied a string of celebrities like Gerri Halliwell, Grace Jones, and the Duchess of York to the bash in Vienna. Now Jordan - real name Katie Price - is lined up to attend tonight's (thursday) event, regarded as one of the poshest balls in Europe. But State Opera director Ioan Holender has called for the ball to be scrapped to save it from low rent stars. "The Opera Ball must go. All the gossip about the event is unimportant. It's a mystery to me why anyone is interested in it," he said.
