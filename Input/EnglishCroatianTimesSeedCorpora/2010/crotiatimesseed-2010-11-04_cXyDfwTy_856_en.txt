Retail sales in Croatia have grown 0.4 per cent in real terms year-on-year this September, in large due to last year's low base. In September of 2009 the retail trade had dropped by 12.8 per cent. In addition to the low base for comparison, this year's slight increase is attributed to a 4.8 growth of tourist arrivals and overnight stays this month. The rate of growth, however, is lower than in August because of the smaller contribution from tourism to the overall economy, including the seasonal employment. According to the Raiffeisen Consulting analysts, the slowdown of the rate of growth this month shows that it is too early to talk about recovery. The slowing down of the growth rate in September shows that it is too early to talk about recovery. The elimination of the higher, four percent rate of crisis tax, will have some positive effects however as it will relieve the extra burden which has hit some higher incomes, and influence consumption. But considering that the positive effects will be felt in January, they will have a stronger impact on positive movements in the beginning of 2011 rather than this year. On the other hand, autumn brings new growth of unemployment, and the recovery of consumption depends on the creation of new workplaces and the increase in disposable income. Regardless of the short-term positive effects that the elimination of the crisis tax and extra tourist spending can have on retail sales, the consumption will recover only when the labour market recovers. "On the yearly level we expect the retail sales to drop three per cent, while recovery with mild rates of growth is expected next year," Raiffeisen  Consulting analysts say.
