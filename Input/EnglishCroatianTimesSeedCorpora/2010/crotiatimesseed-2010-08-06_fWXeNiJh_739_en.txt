A carton of milk that turned blue shortly after being opened has been confiscated by Italian food authorities days after a similar incident in which 70,000 mozzarella balls turned blue after opening. After the cheese was seized the Italian health ministry confirmed that it had activated the European "rapid alert" system to warn of possible contamination, and announced emergency control measures. But the discovery of the blue milk has unsettled dairy producers who are demanding to know what caused the mysterious colouration. Cristiana Marcelo from Piombino in Tuscany had opened the bottle of Italian milk before leaving for a week-end holiday and found the milk had turned bright blue when she came back. She said: "I was afraid seeing the blue milk because I had drunk it two days before. "At the moment I feel fine and we are waiting for the local authority tests." The tainted mozzarella discovered earlier was spotted by a shopper in Turin, who noticed it take on a bluish tint when it was exposed to the air. The woman then called the police. The cheese was made for an Italian company, which distributed it to discount supermarkets in the north of the country. Neither the German producer nor the Italian company involved have been named. Health Minister Ferruccio Fazio alerted German authorities who had manufactured the product and the European Commission about the possible contamination. Initial tests at an institute in Turin found the colouring to be caused by a bacterium, but it is unknown how harmful it is. Analysts suggested the colouring could also indicate the presence of copper, nickel or lead in the milk used to make the cheese, or the solution used to preserve it.
