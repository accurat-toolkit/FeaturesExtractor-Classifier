Croatia receives 150 million Euros years as part of the European Union pre-accession funds (PRI) assigned for helping the future members states transition to membership. In a roundtable discussion organized by the National Committee for Monitoring of the Accession Negotiations, Head of Delegation of the European Commission to the Republic of Croatia Paul Vandoren reminded of the need to use these funds efficiently through mature programs, with emphasis on infrastructure-related projects. Croatia must make preparation in order to take advantage of the allotted 2.2 billion structural funds that await it once it enters the European Union. "There is little time and the money must be spent in 24 months," Vandoren warned. He said that the most important thing is to be ready in the pre-accession phase. The Speaker of the Parliament Luka Bebic said that the remaining 10-15 laws from the European package would be put into effect by the end of the year, as they were awaiting constitutional changes that are currently being negotiated. In the last few years, the Croatian Parliament adopted or aligned over 230 laws with European Union legislation. The President of the Committee Vesna Pusic reminded that for the above-mentioned projects, for every 15 Euros that Croatian government invests, European Union gives 85. The failure to use those funds is a direct loss to the country. She added that Croatia's accession to the European Union is one of rare political goals, which political elites cannot accomplish without the participation of the entire society, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List reports.
