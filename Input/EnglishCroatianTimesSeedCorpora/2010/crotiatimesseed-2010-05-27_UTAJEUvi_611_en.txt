Croatian banks have made some efforts in the past months to revive apartment sales, with bank data showing that more people are taking advantage of discounted prices and special mortgage offers. Privredna Banka Zagreb (PBZ Bank), for example, noted a 30 percent increase in approved home mortgage loans in the first four months of this year. Partly responsible for the increase are more affordable loan conditions that the bank has been offering since the beginning of March. Drazen Dumancic from PBZ said that especially attractive are new offers targeting younger people under 40, with discounted interest rate of 6.5 per cent for first 12 months. Variable rate starting at 6.6 per cent is applied to the remainder of the loan. The Zagreb Bank informs that their action Apartment Day (Dan za Stan) has attracted some 300 visitors during the last month, and that 204 apartments on offer have been reserved. "Clients are mostly interested in two bedroom apartments of about 40 to 45 square meters, and three-bedroom apartments of 55 to 65 square meters," the bank says.  The average loan amount is around 80,000 Euros to be repaid between 25 to 30 years. In the first four months of 2010, almost half a billion kunas (69 million Euros) of mortgages have been issued, which is ten per cent more then in the same period last year, the Zagreb bank says. Erste bank has also started a special offer in cooperation with construction firms which will last until 30 June. It has introduced lower fixed interest rates of four to 5.85 per cent for 24 to 30 months, depending on the model of credit and client's creditworthiness. The bank says 198 apartments have been sold so far.
