A computer-addicted couple let their real life baby starve to death while they raised a virtual daughter online, say police. The couple spent 12 hours a night at internet cafes while their three-month-old daughter was left home alone at their apartment in Suwon, South Korea. Police say they had become hooked on living online and were raising an avatar daughter through their Prius game profiles. Dad Kim Yoo-chul and mum Choi Mi-sun called police when they returned from one session and found their daughter dead. But officers became suspicious of how severely dehydrated the tot was and have charged the couple with child abuse and neglect. Police said they had become so obsessed with the daughter they were raising online that they appeared not to take seriously their duty toward their real daughter. Worried about their addiction to the games, Kim's parents had been taking care of the baby, but had returned her to her mum and dad just two weeks before she died. Online games are massively popular in South Korea, with professional gamers becoming celebrities through live televised tournaments. But critics say the popularity, which also nets huge profits for tech companies, comes at a steep price, with ever more bizarre incidents hitting the headlines. A 28-year-old man dropped dead recently after playing his favourite game Starcraft for 50 hours non-stop without eating and drinking. In another incident, a gamer, enraged that an opponent had killed the character he had put so much effort into creating, quickly found out his adversary's location through a chat built into the game, took a taxi across town and stabbed him.
