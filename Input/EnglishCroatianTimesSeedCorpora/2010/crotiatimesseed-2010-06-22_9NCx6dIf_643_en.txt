The first joint meeting of the Croatian government and the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) was launched yesterday (Mon) in Vila Dalmacija in Split. The meeting - intended as a confirmation of the good relations between the two countries - took place under the chairmanship of Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of BH Nikola Spiric. Relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina are high on the list of Croatia's foreign policy priorities, not only because they share a 1,001 kilometres of border, but also because a large number of Croatians live in BH, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. "I think that today is the beginning of stronger cooperation between us and proves that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia are not only neighbouring countries but also countries that continuously build friendships and bridges of cooperation," the Croatian Prime Minister said, expressing her belief that the meeting would be an important contribution. "I would like to emphasise that BH received a NATO action plan with great support from the Croatian republic, and that we will continue to support it on its Euro-Atlantic journey," she added. Kosor expressed her desire to strengthen economic and border cooperation, but also expanding relations in the areas of science, technology and culture. "Our bilateral relations are on the rise," Spiric affirmed. 'I agree with PM Kosor that borders should not be used for separation, but that all depends on the politicians. Where people are in conflict with time and future unfortunately, the borders are much firmer." "I hope that there will come a time when we will talk about the border and all of the matters of interest to both of our countries," he added.
