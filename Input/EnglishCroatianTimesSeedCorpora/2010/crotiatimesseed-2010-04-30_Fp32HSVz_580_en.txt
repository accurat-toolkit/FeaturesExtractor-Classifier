President Ivo Josipovic has said that he may intervene in the dispute over the diaspora vote that has not been included in proposed changes to the constitution if political parties ask for his mediation. The Croatian government suggested several constitutional amendments on Tuesday that would help bring Croatia closer to closing its EU accession negotiations. They did not deal with the contested question of the diaspora vote that the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) - of which Josipovic is a member - wanted included. SDP wants the diaspora to vote at a limited number of designated locations or only in diplomatic offices abroad in order to make the process more transparent and less susceptible to fraud.  A poll earlier this year showed that 80 percent of Croatians supported the idea that the voting be limited to five diplomatic offices and consulates in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Currently Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina can vote at 130 locations. European Parliament rapporteur for Croatia, Austrian MEP Hannes Swoboda, said earlier this year that Croatia's constitutional changes should deal with the diaspora question.  He added that Croatians also voted in other parts of the world but that only in Bosnia-Herzegovina could they do so in every village. The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) is resisting such a change because a lot of their support comes from those voters, analysts say.  However, EU pressure and SDP insistence could force them to compromise.  A two-thirds majority is needed for all constitutional changes, and, without SDP support, other amendments cannot be passed. Some parliamentary representatives, however, say that regulation of the voting in the diaspora is not a constitutional question but rather an issue that should be dealt with by election laws.
