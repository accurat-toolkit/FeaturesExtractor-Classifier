India's 'Octo boy' - a modern day elephant man born with eight limbs - has been given another blow as doctors told him: "You have your dead brother inside you." A European charity, which is helping the boy, asked for reports that resulted in his first proper medical examination. The shocking result - he not only has the legs and arms of his dead brother but also the head and chest growing inside him. Doctors who examined Deepak Kumar Paswan say he has an almost complete Siamese twin attached to him - with half inside, including a head which will need to be removed for him to live a normal life. Children's doctor Franz Kroesselhuber from Innsbruck Hospital in Austria who is liaising with Indian doctors to get the best treatment for Deepak said: "We are trying to discuss the best place to carry out the operation - Europe or India. If it is simply a case of removing the dead twin and he is not attached to any organs like the liver it would probably be best to stay there. But if it's more complicated - we obviously have access to more sophisticated equipment here. But I am still waiting to get more information from my Indian colleagues." When Deepak was born at Bihar, eastern India, with extra limbs growing out of his chest, doctors warned he wouldn't live more than a few days. Incredibly, he survived and despite having seven limbs he appears perfectly healthy today. But while he is worshipped as a God by some in his village, the tragic eight-year-old also has others who believe he brings bad luck. And now he's desperate for surgery to remove his dead twin so he can start to live a normal life. When Deepak's mum Indu was pregnant with him she had no idea he'd be born so deformed. And although Deepak is relatively healthy, his parasitic twin often suffers skin infections that itch and Deepak scratches them constantly The biggest problem though is the isolation he feels. "I am tired of being different," says Deepak. "I just want to live normally."
