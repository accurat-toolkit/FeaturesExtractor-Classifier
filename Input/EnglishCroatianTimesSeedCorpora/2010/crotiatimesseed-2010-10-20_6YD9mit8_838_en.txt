Croatian gymnasiums could have 5,000 fewer students in five years' time according to predictions from the Ministry of Education. There were 49,000 secondary school students this year, out of which 30 per cent or 14,500 attended grammar schools. The new criteria for establishing four-year high schools could lower those numbers by 30 per cent. Out of the total number of primary school students, little more than 20 per cent are expected to go onto grammar schools in five years' time. In the majority of European countries however there is a trend of increasing the number of spaces in grammar schools, and experts here are also suggesting that the quotas should be increased. According to the Ministry's criteria, the ideal high school would have between 400 and 500 students. For schools on islands or in more isolated areas in which a larger number of smaller schools may be more appropriate, the minimum number of students would be 150. If such rules were strictly enforced, 30 to 40 schools or 10 per cent of the current number would be eliminated. Also planned is the elimination of programs for which there are no placements and which are not competitive on the international labour market. Other schools will also face strict criteria, so there will be no three-year vocational schools without workshops for practical lessons, no medical schools in places without suitable hospitals, and no nautical schools in continental Croatia. Future school programs will follow the demands of the market and the particularities of the region in which they are established, the daily Vecernji List writes.
