Varazdin was voted the number one city to live in and one of the main drivers of Croatia's economy according to the Croatian edition of Forbes magazine. It replaced last year's winner Rovinj which is now in 13th place.  Varazdin is followed by Samobor, Dubrovnik, Cakovec and Zagreb in fifth place. The study is based on rigorous criteria.  The overall performance of a cities' entrepreneurial sector, like business' income, profits and the number of employed forms the core of the analysis. This year's results show that continental Croatia has outdone last year's winner, in the coastal region. Big losers this year are Split, Zadar and Sibenik which fell off the list. The mayor of Varazdin Ivan Cehok was confident about his city's placement. "Of course we are the best," he said to the Croatian daily Jutarnji List when informed of the results. The main impetus behind Varazdin's climb was the increase in business profits. The industrial centre of north-western Croatia is the third in the country in terms of its GDP, emerging last year as one of the most "business friendly" cities. Its Free Zone is the largest export-oriented green field investment in the country. Varazdin also has the lowest unemployment rate at five percent, one of the best universities and well thought out housing policy, the report finds. The so-called Zagreb ring also did very well in this year's rating. The towns of Samobor, Sveta Nedelja, Velika Goric and Zapresic all neighbouring the capital scored high points, an indicator that many people are choosing these places for their easier (and cheaper) life quality while they continue to work in Zagreb.
