In recognition of the importance of the expansion of the country's tourism sector Croatian banks have introduced a number of credit line offers for small and medium-sized businesses. In addition to their own lines of credit, banks are cooperating with the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HBOR), various ministries, as well as the county and municipal authorities. Croatian Postal Bank (HPB) has said it will offer credit intended for  developing tourism activity to encourage the construction of hotels, apartments and restaurants. Clients can receive loans from 4,100 Euros to 140, 000 Euros, with a repayment period of up to 10 years and the possibility of grace period of up to 12 months. The bank says it expects the loans to be used for buying, upgrading or constructing new facilities, or reconstruction and furnishing of new spaces. In preparation for the tourist season, HPB also introduced short-term loans, intended for clients who rent accommodations or tourist facilities up to 15,000 Euros with flexible repayment period of 24 months. Many others, such as Zagreb Bank, Hypo and Erste offer similar lines of credit intended for tourism sector entrepreneurs, the Croatian business portal Poslovni Dnevnik writes. Erste bank has eight million kunas (1.1 million Euros) for citizens and small and medium-sized businesses, with the amount of credit depending on the volume of business and the possibility of payback from future money flows. Hypo bank meanwhile has signed an agreement with the Istria County to offer loans within its "Local projects for development of small businesses" programme.
