After almost two decades of absence, the Croatian furniture makers are looking to wow the Russian market once again with their offers of high-end oak products aimed at well off clients. Pieces of Croatian furniture attracted a lot of attention from the visitors at the opening of the international furniture fair MEBEL 2010 in Moscow yesterday (Mon), the daily Vecernji List writes. With the exception of the Spin Valis from Pozega, many of of this year's Croatian exhibitors have not been present on Russian markets for almost two decades. Rajko Ruzicka from Croatian Chamber of Economy said that the goal is to present high-end, well-designed modern furnishings made out of well-known Slavonian oak, which has been a recognized brand for centuries. Croatian company Lazingrad, which specializes in furnishing of Russian wood vacation houses known as dachas, has also attracted a lot of interest. The company's owner Miljenko Milinovic says that they are looking for a Russian business partner that would help them break onto the market. DIN Novoselac company is also aware of the potential of the Russian market even though the company already exports 95 per cent of their assortment. The Deputy Director Hrvoje Svetina believes that young, wealthy Russians will soon recognize the quality of the Croatian full oak wood which looks good and lasts a long time. Ruzicka says that Croatia has been realizing a foreign trade surplus in wood products and furniture exports for years, with it reaching 100 million dollars in 2009. Comparing the first eight months of this year with the same period in 2009, the exports have increased 11 per cent while imports went down 20 per cent. That has resulted in a four-fold increase in the foreign trade surplus, the daily Vecernji List writes.
