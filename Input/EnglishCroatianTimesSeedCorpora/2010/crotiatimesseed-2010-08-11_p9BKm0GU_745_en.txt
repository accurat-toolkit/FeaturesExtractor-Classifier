Zadar General hospital has complained about the hassle involved in collecting unpaid medical bills left by tourists, the local newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija writes. The hospital has experienced a 30 per cent increase in foreigners being treated since the beginning of the tourist season. The headache for administrators trying to collect the unpaid bills has increased proportionally, the paper writes. "When we give them the bill they pretend either to be mute or crazy, as though they did not know that they have to pay. Sometimes they give fake IDs or pretend to have lost their passport or documents," said deputy director of Zadar hospital Neven Birkic. He added that when a hospital administers emergency assistance to a patient who does not have insurance, it does not have the right to demand a passport or any other documents unless the patient is willing to hand them over. But the hospital cannot keep the patient until police arrive which means that they can walk away without paying the bill. Zadar hospital lost 370,000 kunas (51,000 Euros) last year related to these cases. Split hospital, on the other hand, sees few such cases, the head of the emergency departments in Split-Dalmatia County dr. Leo Luetic said. "There are cases when a foreign patients says before the treatment that he or she does not have the money to cover its cost. Still, if the patient is in vital danger or could face a disability, we are obligated by law to help him." The paying for health services of foreign citizens is usually governed by bilateral agreements between the two states with service then being free of charge. Croatia has such agreements with most of the countries from where the majority of tourists come from. In those cases, the patients pay only a 25-40 (3.5 - 5.5 Euros) fee.
