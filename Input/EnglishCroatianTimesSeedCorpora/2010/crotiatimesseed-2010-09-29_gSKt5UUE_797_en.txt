The majority of Croatians have harbored romantic feelings for two or more people at the same time and 43 per cent have given in to the attraction, a new survey shows. Seventy four per cent of 400 people between the ages of 25 and 55 that were surveyed by the publishing house Dvostruka Duga has admitted to having been romantically interested in another person while already in a relationship.  More men than women succumb to such fantasies, or 80 to 72 per cent. Both sexes are equal when it comes to acting upon them with 43 per cent admitting to have done so. The author of thirty-something books on the topic Adrian P. Kezele says the survey confirms what he has believed for a long time. "The data from our survey show a slightly higher percentage than similar investigations done on the entire population, but our respondents were more honest.  Whatever the case, many people in addition to their partner are attracted to someone else." His latest book -"Love - more is not too much" (Ljubav-vise nije previse) - is aimed at those who "are willing to accept that in a relationship with more than one partner there does not necessarily have to be something bad or immoral." A key to such relationships is honesty. Many more relationships would survive an open confession about "love excursions" and the inclusion of a third person than is believed,  Kezele says, and that it is healthier to face who we are than to live a lie. Psychiatrist Vladimir Gruden agrees, but only when both partners are equally mature. "My practice tells me one should not admit adultery. That usually hurts the partner for their entire life, and the person who made the 'excursion' can realise tomorrow that it was nothing, a moment of weakness," says Gruden.
