Hollywood star Angelina Jolie has been banned from filming her new movie in Bosnia-Herzegovina after authorities withdrew her permission to work in the country. The film - about a Bosnian Muslim woman who falls for the Serbian soldier who rapes her during the bitter Balkan Wars - has outraged politicians and women's groups in the country. Bosnia's Federal Ministry of Culture announced the ban yesterday (Weds) after the country's leading women's group "Women: War Victims" launched a formal protest. The ban on filming in Zenica was later authorised and signed by Culture Minister Gavrilo Grahovac. "We will only give them a permit to film if we can see the script and it shows us the story is not one that insults Bosnian women, victims of war," Minister Grahovac said. Most of the controversial movie - being directed by Jolie - is being filmed in Hungary, but the plot has infuriated the hundreds of thousands of women who suffered in the Bosnian war. Victim Bakira Hasecic told local media: "We have demanded from the authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina to know just who has authorised a permit for Angelina Jolie to film at locations in our country. I can't bear to see again scenes of rape in front of my eyes. "The scene of my experience and of the rapes of numerous Bosnian woman - that is our pain and not some kind of movie romance," she added. International organisations estimate that thousands of women were raped during the Bosnian war in the 1990s. In February 2001, the United Nations (UN) war crimes court for former Yugoslavia convicted three Bosnian Serbs for crimes against humanity and war crimes after they were found guilty of rape and the forced prostitution of Bosnian Muslim women. Authorities are terrified that the film will reignite decades old grievances and conflicts. "With one film, Angelina Jolie is in danger of restarting the war all over again all by herself," said one official.
