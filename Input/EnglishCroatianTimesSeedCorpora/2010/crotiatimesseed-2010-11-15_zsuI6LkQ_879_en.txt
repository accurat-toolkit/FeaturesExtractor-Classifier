Despite the country's internet fame for being amongst the top south eastern European destinations for female sex tourism, gigolos are still hard to find in Croatia. There have been some 600,000 women from the West who have practised sexual tourism in the last 25 years. Many of them are regular visitors in search of "romance" in warmer destinations such as the Caribbean and Africa. But an investigative piece in Croatian daily Jutarnji List reveals that, despite the country's reputation on some internet portals, professional gigolos are still a rare find in Croatia. However an ad asking for a gigolo - placed on two internet portals by the journalist working on the report - drew rather large response, not only from Croatia, but also some of the country's neighbours. While most of these men have not had much experience in the field, few had sent along an established menu of services and corresponding prices. Many also emailed photographs as well as their limits, or things that they were not willing to do for money. One of the male gigolos interviewed by the daily is the 27-year-old Mario who embarked on this as a side-job after a short-lived affair with a Slovenian tourist. Instead of a goodbye letter, the woman left him an envelope full of cash at the reception desk. Mario soon realized that this could be a great second source of income. Still, none of the escort agencies advertising on the internet portals offer male escorts and only an ad here and there can be found with males offering services. These are often, however, offers of companionship for other men rather than women, the daily Jutarnji List writes.
