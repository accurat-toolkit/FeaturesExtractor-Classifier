The average Croatian has tripled his or her wealth in the last ten years, Credit Suisse bank's Global Wealth Report shows. Croatia has found itself amongst the group of countries with "satisfactory" wealth per resident. Despite a bad starting point in 2000 when the average adult Croat had only 8,586 dollars, ten years later average Croat's wealth rose to 25,243 dollars in large part due to an increase in the value of non-financial property. Croatians hold 0.05 per cent of world's wealth today, the portal Business writes. The majority of Croats has between 10,000 and 100,000 dollars' worth of property (some 50.7 per cent of the population), while only 3.4 per cent has more than 100,000 dollars.  Some 37.8 per cent of Croatians have more than 1,000 but fewer than 10,000 dollars' worth, while eight per cent own less than 1,000 dollars of property. Despite the worst recession since the 1930s, the average citizen of this planet has increased his wealth by 72 per cent in the last decade. According to the bank's press release, there are over 1,000 billionaires at the top of the global wealth pyramid, of which 245 are in Asia Pacific, 230 are in Europe and 500 are in North America. Moving down the wealth pyramid, there are 80,000 ultra-high-net-worth individuals (average wealth per adult above USD 50 million). Of the 24 million other high-net-worth individuals (average wealth per adult of USD 1 million to USD 50 million), just over 800,000 are in China, around 170,000 are in India and over four million are in the rest of Asia Pacific. Below this, more than 330 million individuals have average wealth per adult of USD 100,000 to USD 1 million. Switzerland and Norway have emerged as the richest nations in the world in terms of average wealth per adult, which stands at USD 372,692 and USD, 326,530 respectively. They are followed by Australia, which is in third place with average wealth per adult of USD 320,909 and Singapore with average wealth per adult of USD 255,488. Figures for Australia and Singapore have both doubled in the last decade.
