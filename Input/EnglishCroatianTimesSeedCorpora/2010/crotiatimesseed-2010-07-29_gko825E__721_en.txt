Glasgow Rangers are ready to raise their offer for Rapid Vienna star Nikica Jelavic, it has been claimed. British sports press reveal today (Thurs) that the Scottish league champs consider offering two million Euros in their attempts to procure the Croatian striker's services. Jelavic has become a target for top clubs in various European leagues after he delivered stellar performances in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League group last autumn. Portuguese giants Benfica, Premiership side Blackburn Rovers and German Bundesliga team Hamburger SV have also entered the chase for the 24-year-old former Zulte Waregem ace who is expected to be part of his club's starting eleven against Bulgarian side PFC Beroe Stara Zagora in the third Europa League qualifying round tonight. While Rapid executive manager Alfred H rtnagl stressed interested clubs have to come up with a convincing sum to tempt the club to let their strongest striker go, Jelavic spoke out about the issue himself for the first time earlier this week, Austrian Times has reported. "There has always been interest. My agent now told me it's Rangers who want me. I can assure Rapid supporters to give my best as long as I play for the club - whenever this will be," he told Austrian sports dailies. Rapid - who had a bad start into the season with two defeats in a row - reportedly demand around four million Euros for the national team ace to ensure being able to snatch a equivalent replacement before the summer transfer window shuts. Jelavic, who joined the team of Peter Pacult in 2008, could leave on a free transfer next year. The Austrian Bundesliga will continue with two matches on Saturday and three games on Sunday. Rapid are set to clash with the league's powerhouse Red Bull Salzburg on 4pm on Sunday. National broadcaster ORF will screen the match live.
