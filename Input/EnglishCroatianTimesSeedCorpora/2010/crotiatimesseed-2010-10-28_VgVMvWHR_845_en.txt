Unpaid salaries are a growing problem in Croatia, unions warned at yesterday's (Wed) discussion held in commemoration of the "World Day of Decent Work" which was celebrated on October 7th. The president of the Independent Croatian Trade Unions Kresimir Sever said that the situation regarding unpaid salaries is worsening continuously due to the crisis. He warned that the dignity of work and workers is tied to the regular payment of wages. According to the data from August, the total of unpaid claims has reached 31.9 billion kunas (4.4 billion Euros).  In addition, a wave of liquidations could be expected soon as some businesses have filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of the year. The Croatian Employers Association (HUP) says that they do not support those who do not pay salaries, taxes and contributions, but add that unions should solve these problems on the company level rather than in public. The World Bank' lead economist Jan Rutkowski warned of the problems that have been burdening the Croatian economy for years and which affect the position of the country's workers. He mentioned the issue of high labour costs, which makes the Croatian economy much less competitive than that of countries such as Hungary or the Czech Republic, and results in fewer investments and lower rates of growth. In addition, a part of the working age population is not active in the labour market in Croatia, due to a problem of incompatibility between the knowledge and skills of workers and the needs of the labour market, he added.  This issue must be solved, especially as the population of the country is rapidly ageing, the portal Business writes.
