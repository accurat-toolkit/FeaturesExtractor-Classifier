The Hague Tribunal has published part of a diary written by Serb war leader Ratko Mladic in which he outlines meetings with Croatian generals in which they arranged shipments of arms and oil and a mutual war against Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks). The extract was published as evidence against Jadranko Prlic, Slobodan Praljak and other heads of the self-proclaimed Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosna - an unrecognised entity formed on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war - who are being tried in the Hague. According to Mladic's diary, at a meeting in 1993 with Milivoj Petkovic, the then head of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO, a military formation of Herzeg-Bosna) and later replaced by Praljak, Mladic noted that 1.2 million Deutsche Marks had been paid to him for weapons and "services." They also arranged an additional transfer of 8.09 million Deutsche Marks for the following week. At the time HVO was financed by Croatia, so all of the money had come from there, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. At another meeting in 1992, Mladic met with a delegation from Croatia and Herzeg-Bosna, which included Slobodan Praljak who later became HVO commander in 1993. According to the notes, Praljak had wanted Serbs and Croats to stop fighting as the real danger came from the Bosnian Muslims. He assured Mladic that the agreement between then presidents of Croatia Franjo Tudjman and Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic was only a formal agreement, made on the insistence of the United States that wanted to ingratiate itself to the Islamic world. At another meeting, Praljak said: "We are on a good path towards forcing Alija (Izetbegovic) to divide Bosnia." Mladic is wanted for crimes of war committed during the war in Bosnia that lasted from 1991-1995. He has not yet been apprehended, and his family has recently requested that he be declared dead.
