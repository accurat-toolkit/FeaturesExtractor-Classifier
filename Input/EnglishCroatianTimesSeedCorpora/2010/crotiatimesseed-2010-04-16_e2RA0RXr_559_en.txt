The demand for Croatian tourist destinations is good in various foreign markets and experts expect at least as many if not more visitors than last year. At the CROTour 2010 tourism fair in Zagreb, the Croatian National Tourist Board (HTZ) said that Europeans are increasingly interested in Croatia but that their "calculated spending" which continues this year will give preferences to more affordable and closer destinations. In that sense, Croatia has some of the advantage, but like all other tourist destinations, it must fight for each one of its guests with good promotion, discounts and excellent value for the money. The Director of the National Tourist Board office in Germany Zlatko De eljin expects better results this year compared to last, pointing out that at the moment the greatest demand is for bookings in car camps, private accommodation and sailing. Goran Blazic, the head of HTZ in Slovenia, said that he expects a three to five percent increase of tourists from that neighbouring country, the Croatian business portal Business.hr reports. Like last year, in Italy, Croatia could be the third most desirable destination (after France and Spain). If it manages to resist the competition of more affordable destinations that could have a drastic influence, it is possible that the number of visitors from Italy could grow by two percent, Klaudio Stojnic director for Italian market said. Ranko Vlatkovic believes that the same number of Austrians will come to Croatia this year, but there is a possibility that there will be more tourists considering that research shows that Euro's value increases by 20 percent in Croatia.
