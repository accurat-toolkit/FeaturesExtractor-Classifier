She caused panda-monium among keepers when she grabbed her baby like this - but its actually just a bear's way of showing motherly love. These are the first pictures of the first giant panda cub born this year to panda mummy Zhuyun at Southwest China's Sichuan Province. The male cub was born pink and almost hairless with a weight of 159.5 grams and a length of 14.8cm at the panda breeding centre's Bifengxia base in the a'an reserve, south of Wolong. After careful observation, both the mother and the cub were in good health despite the brief pandemonium caused when the mother decided to take baby for a brief walk. The cub's mother, named Zhuyun, mated with a male named Lingling in March and began to show signs of giving birth to the young in mid June. The baby will not be named yet for another 100 days in line with tradition which always dictates that panda cubs live without a name when first born. It is Zhuyun's second cub. Her first cub, Minmin, is among the 10 giant pandas sent to Shanghai during the 2010 World Expo. Both Zhuyun and Lingling belong to the China Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre. Giant pandas are among the world's most endangered species. According to the State Forestry Administration, about 1,590 pandas live in the wild, mostly in the mountains of Sichuan, and more than 210 live in captivity. The 200,000-hectare Wolong Nature Reserve, founded in 1963, is home to the China Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre, which was damaged in the massive earthquake of May 2008 and almost all of the 150-plus pandas under its custody were sent to the Ya'an reserve. The Wolong centre is being rebuilt.
