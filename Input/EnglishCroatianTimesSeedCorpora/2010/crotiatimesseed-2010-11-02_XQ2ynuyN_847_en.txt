The vast majority of Croatians see their country's current situation as "very bad," bringing the number of pessimists up by 49.7 per cent in just the last three years. Some 11.8 per cent of Croats thought the same three years ago at the beginning of the current government's mandate. Today, 61.5 per cent share this belief, research carried out by the Meidana Fides agency shows. The survey was conducted between October 26 and 30 of this year on a representative sample of 743 people. When those considering the current situation as "predominantly bad" are added to these numbers, the total of the county's dissatisfied sky rockets to 90.9 per cent. The number of optimists who believe the situation is "predominantly good" has dwindled to a meagre 8.5 per cent from 48.5 per cent three years ago, the daily Jutarnji List writes. The most popular of the current government's ministers is the Interior Minister Tomislav Karamarko, who, while far from receiving great praise, is credited for tackling the country's corruption problems. He received a modest 2.8 points on the scale of one to five. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Finance Minister Ivan Suker, considered the worst minister largely due to the fact that he has continued taking on new debt, the daily Jutarnji List writes. Almost a third of those surveyed (29.4 per cent) considers neither of the two primary politicians - the Croatian Democratic Union's (HDZ) Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) head Zoran Milanovic - as capable of leading the country in its current condition. Milanovic still remains ahead of Kosor, however, with a 4.8 per cent lead. When asked to name a politician that would be capable of governing the country, 16.6 per cent of those surveyed mentioned Milanovic, 13.3 said Kosor, 12.6 favoured the country's president Ivo Josipovic, while 10.5 per cent put their faith into the Croatian National Bank's (HNB) governor Zeljko Rohatinski.
