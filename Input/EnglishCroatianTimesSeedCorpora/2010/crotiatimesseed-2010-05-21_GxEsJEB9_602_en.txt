Singer Kim Petras has released a 45 second version of one of the songs from her first album in advance of her appearance as one of the guests of honour at this year's Comet awards. The new song Hidden Affair has already notched up hundreds of hits and her previous song Last Forever had over 200,000 plays from fans. Kim's manager Esther Rieger said: "All Kim's marketing is done by her fans on the internet and it's amazing how much interest her music generates." Stunning Kim, 17, will walk down the red carpet tonight as one of the guests of honour at the Comet awards live from Oberhausen, Germany organised by music channel Viva. Kim is no stranger to being in front of the camera having already worked as a model and been photographed by Benetton and as the face of the German hairdressing Unisex chain. Kim has appeared on television shows and in magazines all over the world but has so far turned down requests to perform from London through to Rome while she continues to finish the material for her new album - expected to be out this summer. She said: "I want to make sure I have something worthwhile to show my fans." At the age of 15 she was discovered by a music producer via Youtube, who went on to produce and release her first songs. Kim was also the power behind her first music video for her single "Die For You" that she wrote, and helped to produce, direct and star in. Now she is producing her debut album with the producers of Bionic Ballroom (Michael Jackson, Ofra Haza, Thomas D) and delivers new demos she has composed herself to her team weekly - and there is a sneak preview of this exciting new work Hidden Affair on her page.
