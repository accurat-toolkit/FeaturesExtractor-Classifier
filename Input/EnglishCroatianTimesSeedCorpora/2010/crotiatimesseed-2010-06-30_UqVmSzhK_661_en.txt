Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria and her husband basketball player Tony Parker will visit the Adriatic coast of Croatia in July, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reports. The couple will spend their holidays in Vodice (Dalmatia) starting 9 July.  Parker is expected to perform as an MC at the popular club Hacienda alongside the famouse hip-hop DJ Cut Killer. The two will be performing their "DJ Cut Killer and Tony Parker Show," while the TV actress will be the guest of honour for the evening. Before the famous foreign guests, visitors to Hacienda will be entertained by the well known Croatian hop-hop DJ Phat Phillie. Eva Longoria has recently revealed she loved being a housewife in real life, Austrian Times has reported. Speaking about how her private life has changed since marrying basketball star Tony Parker, the 35-year-old actress said: "I enjoy being a housewife! I cook, I clean up, I do Tony's washing." Asked whether she and Parker planned to have children, Longoria told Madonna magazine: "Tony and me work on expanding our family. But the producer (of 'Desperate Housewives') forbid me to become pregnant this year. Seriously!  ('Desperate Housewives' co-star) Marcia's (Cross) pregnancy came as a bid surprise and posed a big problem for the script writers." Longoria spends a lot of time in Hollywood, Los Angeles, for shooting of "Desperate Housewives", while her husband plays for NBA team San Antonio Spurs. Speaking about how they manage to see each other regularly, Longoria explained: "I work three to four days a week and then fly to Texas to spend a long weekend with Tony. "This means there's sex just on the weekends," she added, laughing.
