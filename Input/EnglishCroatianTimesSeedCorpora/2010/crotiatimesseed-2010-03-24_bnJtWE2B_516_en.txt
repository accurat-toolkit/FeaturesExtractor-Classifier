A vigilante dad who gunned down two members of a paedophile ring who'd abused his daughter in Lithuania is believed to have fled to Britain Drasius Kedys, 27, shot dead a judge and a woman who raped his four-year-old daughter after local police and judges ignored his pleas for justice. Now the killer - dubbed Judge Dread by fans - is believed to be hiding in the UK among a flood of immigrants from eastern Europe. Lithuanian police - who have been chasing the Death Wish dad all over Europe - believe he has changed his appearance and assumed a new identity as an immigrant worker. "No-one really notices these people. To most westerners, a Pole, a Lithuanian, Ukrainian - they are all faceless and all the same," said one officer. Kedys has been on the run since last October when he fled after gunning down judge Jonas Furmanavicius, 47, and Violeta Narusevicien , 29, after his daughter Deimantela accused them of raping her. "He had complained to police but they did nothing. He's an ordinary man accusing a judge. In the end he dealt out his own justice," said one family friend. Meanwhile, Kedys has become a cult hero among Lithuania's ordinary people, who say they are fed up with widespread corruption. Demonstrators carrying posters proclaiming Kedys a "child protector" took to the streets of Lithuania's capital Vilnius and second city Kaunas in a show of support. And two Facebook pages dedicated to him have been inundated with hundreds of messages of approval, some from the UK offering him sanctuary in Britain. Mugs and T-shirts have gone on sale bearing the logo: "Drasius: Lone avenger".
