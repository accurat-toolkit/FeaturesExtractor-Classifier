Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor will introduce the government's anti-recession programme "with or without consensus," she said Friday at a conference organised by Croatian daily Jutarnji List and Microsoft Windays Business. The programme consists of more than 60 measures affecting the economy, scientific sector, public administration and local government. "This is my programme, I checked all the measures from the first to the last and I have taken on a lot of responsibility. I will implement them with or without consensus. We cannot wait anymore," Kosor said. "The measures present a radical move for a better tomorrow. We should have done this two, four, 10 even 15 years ago," the PM continued adding that she could not have done it earlier in her mandate but now that she is "in the saddle and holding the reins" she can assure that the "horse" is moving in the right direction. Some are short-term measures, while others will be introduced over a longer period of time until 2020, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List reports. One short-term measure introduces three income tax brackets instead of the current four and eliminates crisis tax starting with November 1st. One of the crisis areas, according to the government is the current pension system which will be 17 billion kunas (2.3 billon Euros) short this year. The rise in prices of energy sources is another issue, the PM pointed out. She said the country would not be facing a current sharp rise in electricity prices if small incremental increases had happened over the last few years when such measures were avoided. Kosor called on all parliamentary parties to reach a consensus on the implementation of the measures.  She said she  was confident the measures would get public support. "Why?" Kosor asked rhetorically. "So that we are all better off tomorrow."
