A typical Croatian family was likely to earn less but spend more in June according to new data. According to the figures from the Independent Trade Unions of Croatia a typical family of four needed 6,631.27 kunas (916 Euros) in June to pay their bills, not including accommodation or transport. That is an increase of 0.03 per cent from May. And the report warned that with the average salary of 5,250 kunas (725 Euros), it was only possible to cover 79 per cent of these costs. That was 1.73 per cent less than in the previous month due to a 113 kunas (15.6 Euros) drop in the average net salary. If the costs of renting an apartment are added to the basket, that would bring its value to 8,428.69 kunas (1,165 Euros), which means that the average net salary would cover only 62.24 per cent of it. The study also assumes that the family does not have a personal vehicle and that it primarily uses public transport. The cost of two monthly adult and two student tickets are calculated into the consumer basket. However, as part of the workers come from suburbs or neighbouring towns, their cost of transportation will be higher than expected. Croatian citizens owe a total of 122.5 billion kunas (17 billion Euros), which means that the average Croatian's debt is 27, 500 kunas or 3,730 Euros. Croatian external debt was 44.5 billion Euros at the end of March, which means that the external debt of every citizen is around 10,000 Euros. The average pension paid in June 2,160.10 kunas (298 Euros).  The consumer basket for household with two retired person in Zagreb is 3,583.13 kunas (495 Euros), which is 0.10 per cent more than in May.
