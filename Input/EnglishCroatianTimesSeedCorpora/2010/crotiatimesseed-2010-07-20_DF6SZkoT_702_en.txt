The cost and number of Croatia's public sector workers are not too high compared to European averages, analysis by the Institute of Public Finance shows. According to the Institute, Croatia is in 22nd place out of 29 European countries monitored. This contradicts claims that the public sector has an excess of workers since the average of 17 for every 100 employees is below the EU average of 17.6. In education and health Croatia is behind the EU - for every 100 workers, 2.2 are in education, while in the EU there are 4.7. The only significant surplus noted is in public enterprises - 12.5 for every 100 compared to 6.8 in EU. Experts warn that Croatia's main problem is not in numbers or expenses, but rather in inefficiency. Such problems could be solved if Croatia were to model its public sector on Scandinavian countries, the Croatian portal Business writes. But Social Democratic Party's parliamentary representative Gordan Maras agreed only partially with the assessment, and warned that public spending is not realistic given the current state of the Croatian economy. After a two-year fall in GDP, the Croatian economy has gone back to its 2006 levels. The budget then was 25 billion kunas lower (3.5 billion Euros), said Maras, adding that the new budget should be 15 billion kunas (2.1 billion Euros) lower than this year's. Maras criticised the government for not decreasing expenditure enough, saying there was room for savings in subsidies and public enterprises. Experts Zarko Primorac and Damir Novotnya warned that Croatia is in danger of long-term economic stagnation, and there is no exit without new investments that will increase growth, especially in production aimed for export.
