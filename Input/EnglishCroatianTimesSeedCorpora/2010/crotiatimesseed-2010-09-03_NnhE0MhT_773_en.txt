Croatian labour unions will take to the streets if Parliament invalidates the signatures calling for a referendum on labour law amendments, union leaders warned. Responding to the government's allegation that close to half a million of 815,000 signatures they collected in July were questionable, Croatian unions warned that blocking the referendum would mean infringing upon people's rights. One of the union leaders Ozren Matijasevic said that government's moves could only contribute to an even bigger citizen response at the referendum, the daily Jutarnji List writes. Croatian labour unions collected 815,000 signatures - almost double the required number - for  calling a referendum on changes to the country's labour laws that had been proposed by the government.  Now the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Public Administration have called into question the legitimacy of 500,000 signatures over alleged irregularities in the collectin process. Some questionable practices involve formalities, like binding signatures into books in order to prevent subsequent additions or noting various names with same handwriting. The Interior Ministry said that in addition to registered collection locations, signatures were solicited in work places and homes.  Another objection is that some supporters had signed the petion hundreds of kilometres from their domicile address. Unions, however, say that the signature collection is not tied to the place of voting as presidential hopeful do not adhere to such rules when seeking candidacy. The comment that signatures have to be bound - rather than put together in a glued manner - they found ridiculous. Some believe that government's move is just a bluff to force the unions to negotiation. Damir Jakus from Croatian Association of Trade Unions (URSH) said that the Minister of Public Administration Davorin Mlakar should issue clear instructions and the unions would repeat their action.
