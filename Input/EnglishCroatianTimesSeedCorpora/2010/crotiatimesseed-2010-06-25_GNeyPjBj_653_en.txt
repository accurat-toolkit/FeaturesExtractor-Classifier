The permanent representatives of the European Union states gave the green light today (Fri) for opening of the three remaining chapters of Croatia's EU negotiations. The chapter on judiciary is expected to be opened as early as next week at the government Accession Conference, the Croatian business portal Poslovni Dnevnik reports. The Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) today adopted the common negotiating positions for opening the chapters on Competition Policy, Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, and Foreign Security and Defence Policy.  It also reached certain decisions needed for closing the chapter on Public Procurement. The chapter on Taxation has been ready for a month, so next week Croatia is expected to close two and open the three remaining chapters. The opening of the Judiciary chapter had been blocked primarily by some EU states over Hague Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz's dissatisfaction with Croatia's cooperation over access to certain war documents.  Brammertz's latest testimony delivered on 14 June, however, removed these obstacles. The opening of chapter eight on Competition Policy has been delayed because of state aid for shipyards that was not allowed.  Croatian government agreed with the European Commission to approach the restructuring of shipyards through privatization, with the announcement for public tenders as the requirement for opening the chapter. The chapter on Foreign Security and Defence Policy has long been blocked by Slovenia over a maritime border dispute with Croatia.  That obstacle has been removed after Slovenes voted in support of an arbitration agreement at a referendum earlier this month. At the end of the Spanish presidency on June 30, Croatia will have opened all 33 chapters of EU negotiations.
