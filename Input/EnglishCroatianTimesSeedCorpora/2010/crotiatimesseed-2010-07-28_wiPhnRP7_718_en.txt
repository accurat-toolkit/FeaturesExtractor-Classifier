The "morning after" pill may become available in Croatian pharmacies as early as next week, already bringing controversy into Croatian medical circles. The Croatian Agency for Medical Products and Medical Devices issued an approval for the Escapelle pill in April, and it is expected that the final go ahead for its distribution will be given on Thursday. Although Croatian doctors have been prescribing higher doses of regular contraceptive pills for the same purposes for the past two decades, the fact that the Escapelle pill has been registered as a contraceptive has outraged Croatia's Catholic Medical Society. "This is a product for abortion, and to call it a contraceptive is deceiving the public," the Society said in a statement. It warns that the description of side effects is inadequate as it does not property address some issues that could be dangerous for woman's health. "The description makes relative the difference between medicinal and surgical abortion, and abortions with chemical products are prolonged and less safe," the Society said. Many Croatian gynecologists do not agree, preferring the pill to surgical abortion. "This is a high-hormone pill which, when taken within 72 hours after sexual intercourse, prevents conception or the transfer of the fertilized egg into the uterus," Dr. Dubravko Lepusic said. No one can say for sure whether there has been a conception within those 72 hours, he added. Dr. Lepusic sees around 15 young couples who come looking for the "morning after" pill, usually on the weekends.  Considering that there are around 2,000 underage pregnancies in Croatia annually and that 50 per cent of them end in abortion, Dr. Lepusic believes that the pill is a safer method. Many believe that the consequences of abortion such as possible infertility, are much more serious. The Catholic Church has yet to comment on the introduction of the pill into the Croatian market, the daily Jutarnji List writes.
