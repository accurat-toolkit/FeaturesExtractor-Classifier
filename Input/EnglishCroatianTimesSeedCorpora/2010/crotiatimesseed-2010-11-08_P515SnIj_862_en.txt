Blonde glamour model Carthrine Ashima has been turned down by police recruiting officials who say she's too sexy to be a cop.   Cathrine, 28 - who models part time while she works as a nurse - was rejected by force officials in Oslo, Norway, when she applied to become a trainee police officer.   Curvy Cathrine sailed through her fitness test and medical but was rejected after an interview panel quizzed her about her work as a nude model.   "I passed the tests with flying colours but they then told me that my work as a model was the same as being a member of an extreme right-wing organisation.   "It's just terrible political correctness," she told local media.   Now her lawyer Jan Christian Elden has said he will fight the police board's decision.   "I have rarely experienced such unprofessional treatment from a public body," he said.   But police chiefs claim Cathrine - who campaigns for animal rights group PETA - was not banned because of her modelling.   "The applicant was not found suitable on the basis of the following: Work motivation, understanding about the role of the police and a lack of general knowledge," said a statement.   But Cathrine says she knew she wouldn't get the job when a female member of the interview panel confronted her with her modelling pictures.   "During the interview one of the women on the board held up some nude pictures of me and started waving them in my face.   "I think it's too bad that someone in the police thinks I am unfit to be a police officer because of my great body.   "I am not ashamed of my career as model and I have no problems with the photos. I think she was just jealous," she said.
