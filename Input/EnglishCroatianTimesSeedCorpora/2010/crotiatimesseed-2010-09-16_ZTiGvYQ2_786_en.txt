The rising price of cotton on the world markets could lead to more expensive clothing in Croatia, some experts say. Increasing demand and natural disasters in cotton-producing regions of the world like China and Pakistan where 25 per cent of the annual crop has been destroyed have contributed to a sharp rise in the price of that raw material. Cotton has shot up by 50 per cent since 2009, the highest it has been in the last 15 years. The first to advise customers about the impending increase was world fashion chain Primark. Some others, like H&M and Levis, have also been thinking aloud about possible price changes. According to the Austrian Times, Austria is bracing for rising clothing prices. Austrian Industrial Association for Textiles, Clothes, Shoes and Leather (TBSL) head Reinhard Backhausen said on Tuesday that he expected prices in shops to rise by up to five per cent. Experts have debated the potential effects on the Croatian clothing market. While some like Alica Kollar-Cesljas of confectionist Vis Konfekcija in Varazdin say that the increases will be minimal if any occur, economist Ljubo Jurcic thinks prices may go up by as much as 10 per cent. "Looking at it mathematically, the price of clothing would go up 20 per cent, but because of  strong competition and the substitution of cotton with other synthetic materials, the increase in prices of clothing will be half of that," he says. Kollar-Cesljas, on the other hand, thinks that the price of textiles will remain the same as the shrinking purchasing power of the average family has decreased demand, the daily Vecernji List has reported.
