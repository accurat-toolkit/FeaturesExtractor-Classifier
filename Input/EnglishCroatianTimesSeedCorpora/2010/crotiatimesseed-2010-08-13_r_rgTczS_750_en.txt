Italian mayor Gianluca Buonanno from Varallo Sesia in northern Italy wants to tackle organised crime at grassroots level by fining anybody who uses bad language. He said the moral decline that leads to criminal activities stems from a lack of respect for the basics including a respect for God and for other people which is often exhibited by blasphemy and bad language. He said: "We are in a village that has the Holy Mountain - a UNESCO World Heritage Site - on its doorstep and if people do not respect that by using bad words how can we expect them to respect anything." Local officials can now fine anybody who is heard using bad language 100 euros. But mayor Buonanno is not the only one to adopted unusual bylaws in Italy. In Capri, it is an offence to wear a bikini anywhere other than on the beach. At Eraclea, near Venice, building sandcastles is forbidden. And mowing the lawn at the weekend in Forte dei Marmi is also punishable with a fine. The laws are all part of a nationwide crackdown on crime and an associated government decree giving extra law-and-order powers to Italian mayors who have issued a string of often bizarre by-laws to enhance "public decorum." Public displays of affection in a car can earn you a fine of up to 400 pounds in Eboli, feeding pigeons is off-limits in the centre of Lucca while in Novara groups of more than two people are forbidden from lounging around in parks at night. Rodrigo Piccoli, 33, called national radio to protest after he was fined 50 euros for lying down in a park in the northern city of Vicenza to read a book. The mayor has since promised to drop the ban.
