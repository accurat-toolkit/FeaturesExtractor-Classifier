The Croatian government opposes publication of the Homeland War Veterans Register despite the urging of the Republic's President Ivo Josipovic. Following up on his campaign promises, Josipovic has sent a written recommendation to the government asking it to make the names of some 500,000 war veterans public. It is unlikely, however, that the government will heed his recommendation since it believes that doing so could compromise both the privacy and the safety of many veterans. It cites privacy laws that forbid such public disclosure of personal data unless veterans provide written permission. The government also argues that some veterans could be endangered during travel through Serbia and Republika Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina, against whose forces Croatia fought in the 1990s. The government adds that no other country in the world has made such records public. Predrag Matic Fred, a war veteran and adviser to the president, said that no veteran should fear the Register's publication. "The only ones who should fear it are those who behaved dishonestly during the war. Only war criminals should be afraid. All others will be proud to have their names on the list," he told the daily Vecernji List. Josipovic and many veterans want all names made public since many people doubt that Croatia was defended by 500,000 Croats in the 1990s, the number claimed in the Register. Domestic politicians and Croatian veterans have been claiming that many people have acquired veteran status, including pensions, without deserving it. Minister of the Family, Veterans' Affairs and Intergenerational Solidarity Tomislav Ivic has noted that no one has claimed Croatia was defended by 500,000 veterans in one day but rather over a period of four years. The Ministries of Defence and Interior produced the Register in 2005 and updated it in 2008. It has not been revealed how they selected the names on it.
