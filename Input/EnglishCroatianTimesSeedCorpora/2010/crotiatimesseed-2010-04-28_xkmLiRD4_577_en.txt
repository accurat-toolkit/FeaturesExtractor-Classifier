Chechen pro-Russian president Ramzan Kadyrov was behind a botched kidnap attempt on anti-Kremlin dissident that led to his assassination, of official inquiry by Austrian authorities has concluded. Kadyrov - a close ally of Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin - ordered the kidnap of whistler blower Umar Israilov after he fled to Austria seeking asylum, officials confirmed today (yesterday). A year-long investigation by Austria's counter-terrorism branch has denied any part in the killing of Israilov who was cut down in the street by three bullets last year. But the Austrian government's investigators concluded that Kadyrov had ordered the kidnapping of Israilov who was then shot when he broke free from his Chechen captors. Now Austrian prosecutors are considering the report before deciding if any charges will follow against three Chechen exiles in custody. Otto Kaltenbrunner is accused of being the local mastermind for Chechen government agents along with Muslim Dadayev, who is accused of spying on  Israilov and driving the getaway car. Turpal Ali Yesherkayev, is accused, with a fourth man, of confronting the victim as he come out of a grocery store and then chasing him as he fled. The fourth suspect, Lecha Bogatirov, left Austria and returned to Russia after the killing, investigators discovered. He is suspected of shooting Israilov three times with a pistol. Israilov,  27, was a former bodyguard and political official to  Kadyrov before he fell out with the leader's pro-Russian stance. In 2006 he filed a complaint in the European Court of Human Rights in which he accused Kadyrov of participating in abductions, torture and murder as part of a Kremlin-backed campaign again effort against separatists in Chechnya, part of the Russian republic. State prosecution spokesman Gerhard Jarosch said: "It seems he was shot after the kidnapping failed."
