Some fifty members of the right-wing Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) dr. Ante Starcevic gathered on Saturday in front of the Serbian embassy in Zagreb demanding the truth about Croatia's missing people. Under the slogan "tell us the truth about the disappeared, you know it" the group called on to the Serbian government to give information they say they hold about the 1,024 Croatians still missing from the war. "The Yugoslav National Army (JNA) took away over 7,000 people," said one of the protesters. Out of those thousands, 264 were taken to Ovcara near Vukovar where 200 were executed. Sixty-four people just from that group have not yet been found. The president of the party Ruza Tomasic said that they decided to organize the protest when they saw the disappointment of Vukovar victims' mothers upon realization that the documents brought to the city by Serbian president Boris Tadic during his recent visit, were worthless. During his visit to Vukovar, Tadic returned some documents sought by the city's hospital. According to the hospital's director Dr. Vesna Bosanac, only four out of 25 of those documents were of vital importance. "This is still not the original hospital documentation that we are looking for," Dr. Bosanac said. "If they want good neighbourly relations, they should start behaving that way. They should return what has been stolen and they should tell us where are loved ones are," said Tomasic. Tomasic said that if the government does not react to their protest, the party will organize another larger one that would include the parents of the missing, the daily Vecernji List writes.
