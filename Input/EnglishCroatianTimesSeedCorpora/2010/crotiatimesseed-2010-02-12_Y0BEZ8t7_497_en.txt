A multi-millionairre Austrian count claims his human rights were abused in a UK jail - because the prison issue underpants were too small. Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly who owns a palace in Austria and a house in Sloane Square, London spent seven days in a Uk jail as part of a Serious Fraud Office (SFO) fraud investigation into a BAE arms deal. He was eventually released after BAE struck a deal with UK and US authorities over alleged bribery and corruption charges. After returning to his palace in Burgenland, Austria, he said: "In the UK human rights are not exactly respected like they are in Austria. I wasn't given underwear that was my size despite asking for it several times. And they didn't give me a comb." The 56-year-old also complained that the prison issue disposable razor had been used before, saying: "I found stubble in it - so I demanded and was given a vaccination against Hepatitis B." Mensdorff-Pouilly is the husband of former Austrian People's Party ( VP) Health Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat. The SFO was investigating him over allegations he had made illegal payments of around 12 million Euros in return for contracts to deliver Gripen fighter jets to Central and Eastern European countries produced by British defence company BAE Systems he had lobbied for between 2002 and 2008. BAE Systems agreed to pay an overall 320 million Euros to authorities after admitting to criminal charges in response to long-standing corruption allegations in both countries. The exact wording of the SFO's decision is now being checked to find out whether an investigation could continue in Austria or whether Viennese prosecutors had to drop all charges. Paragraph 54 in the Schengen Agreement says someone who faced investigations of the same crime by two European Union (EU) member states could only be sentenced or acquitted once. Vienna state prosecution spokesman Gerhard Jarosch said the SFO has not yet sent the files.
