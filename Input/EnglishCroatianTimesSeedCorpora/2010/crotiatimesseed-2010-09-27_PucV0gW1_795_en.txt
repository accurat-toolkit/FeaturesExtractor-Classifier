Controversial historian David Irving praised Adolf Hitler as "a great man" and his Gestapo as "fabulous policeman" on his shocking tour of Nazi of death camps in German-occupied Poland. Irving - once jailed in Austria for denying the Holocaust - told fans on his 1,500 GBP-a-head tour that Hitler should be compared to Hannibal. His comments - recorded by an undercover reporter for Italian newspaper Correire della Sera - will be studied closely by Polish secret service agents who have been monitoring the tour. Irving said Hitler was not "immoral" but was let down by lesser people in the Nazi regime. "Hitler could be very cruel but he was not immoral. He was just surrounded by 'little' people," said Irving according to the Italian daily. "He was like Hannibal. He held the military forces of the rest of the world for six years. Exactly like Hannibal, but nobody has ever denied the greatness of Hannibal. "Hitler was a great man, one of the greatest Europeans for centuries," he added. But his shocking assessment of the Gestapo - who created and ran the Nazi death camps in Poland - will infuriate Holocaust survivors. "The Gestapo were fabulous policemen. They sent 300,000 to Auschwitz and 800,000 to Treblinka," reports Corriere della Sera. Irving led 11 people from Britain, Germany, Australia and the United States around Hitler's Polish Wolf's Lair headquarters, where he described German officer Claus von Stauffenberg, who tried to assassinate the dictator as a "traitor." And the behaviour of Irving's guests on the tour has raised eyebrows locally, reports the Italian undercover team. During one private dinner after a visit to the death camps one guest called out to cheers and laughter: "What a terrible smell. It's like a gas chamber." Critics have slammed the trip around Hitler's headquarters and the notorious Treblinka death camp referring to it as "Nazi Travel".
