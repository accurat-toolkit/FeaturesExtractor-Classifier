According to the World Bank, Croatia ranks 101 for its attractiveness to foreign investors, the Croatian Radio Television reports. But just how do these investors view Croatia, the media outlet inquired? Yoshisato Kazari, the former manager of Sharp, said that it is very complicated to build a factory in Croatia. "Before the start of the construction, one must ensure the entire infrastructure, right down to the production of parts. It is even harder taking into consideration that China, Vietnam and Turkey are becoming stronger powers." Instead of trying to compete with countries with cheap labour, Croatia should educate its highly qualified people. "Croatia could be a good logistics centre for entry of goods into Europe. Given its geographic location in the heart of Europe and its developed maritime routes, Croatia could be competitive in freight transport and have an advantage in delivering goods to any part of Europe," Kazari said. Last year direct foreign investment dropped below 2.44 billion Euros, under five per cent of GDP. The American Ambassador James B. Foley, speaking in front of the students at the Faculty of Economics in Zagreb said that Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor's economic recovery measures are an example of leadership. "She understood that Croatia cannot afford to sit and do nothing and wait for the crisis to pass.  I was impressed by the fact that plan touches upon many structural problems that have been plaguing the economy for years," Foley said. In its latest report, the International Monetary Fund has also welcomed the Croatian government's economic reforms, predicting that they will strengthen the market and help with Croatia's entry to the EU.
