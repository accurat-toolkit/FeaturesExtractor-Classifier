Two groups calling for the expulsion of Roma people from the west-Croatian county Istria have surfaced on Facebook in the last few days. One of the groups "Vodnjan without Gypsies" managed to attract more than 100 members before it was shut down by administrators.  The group calls for the removal of gypsies from the Istrian town of Vodnjan, located few kilometers from Pula.  In its description it says: "Pigs would be more cultured than they are." Although both pages were soon removed by vigilant administrators, they pose important questions about the county, which is usually known for its tolerance of ethnic and religious diversity. The professor of sociology Elizabeta Pavlovic says that in times of economic crisis it is not unusual for certain groups to become scapegoats for everyone's problems. "People are placing the blame on everyone else, and right wing political activity and racism is increasing. People have seen Sarkozy expel the Roma from France, and are wondering why the same cannot happen in Vodnjan and Istria?" In her opinion many young people who sign up to such groups are not even aware of what they are doing. It is also easier to be a member of a Facebook group because it can be quite anonymous. Istrian police has not yet made any announcements regarding their involvement in the case, but the county head Ivan Jakovcic has condemned the "intolerant and trouble making group."  "To refer to an ethnic group with such insulting and derogatory words is beyond all civilized parameters. Such intolerance is in opposition to the values on which we build our lives and the spirit of community," he said.
