Incest monster Josef Fritzl's brain is to be scanned by a leading neuroscientist in a study to see what makes the world's most dangerous killers tick. Top US neurologist Dr Kent Kiehl is contacting prison officials in Austria to seek Fritzl's permission for the study by a mobile MRI scanner. Crime expert Dr Keihl has scanned the brains of more than 1,200 killers around the world as part of an analysis into why psychopaths kill. Fritzl was jailed for life for imprisoning his daughter Elisabeth in the basement of the family home in Amstetten where he repeatedly raped her for 24 years fathering seven children. The monster admitted killing one baby born with breathing difficulties and tossing the tot's body into an incinerator. "I want to clarify why criminals can torture, rape and kill without showing any sympathy for their victims," Dr Kiehl told Austrian media. "Fritzl's actions are those of a true psychopath. He knew exactly how badly his victims were suffering, but he didn't show any signs of a guilty conscience. He acted without any emotion. "Psychopaths show as little sympathy as we do for the Christmas goose while we carve it. "My studies have shown that the brains of psychopathic killers show reduced activity in the parts where feelings are normally dealt with," he added. Judges were told by prosecution medical experts at Fritzl's trial that he was sane and fit to face charges. Now a scientific finding that he is a classic psychopath could throw his confession into doubt and mean his original trial was unfair, warned Austrian legal experts. "Fritzl has been meeting with his legal team to discuss any grounds for an appeal or a mistrial and this could be exactly what he needs," said one. Fritzl, now 75, has been reading thousands of pages from his case after telling advisers he was a fool to plead guilty. "I let them drag me to the guillotine like a sheep," he said.
