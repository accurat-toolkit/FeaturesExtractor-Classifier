Croatian construction and other companies have been invited to participate in tenders for jobs in Libya, where 50 billion-dollar investment projects are currently underway. Some 50 representatives of Croatian companies were present at yesterday's (Mon) seminar "How to do business in Libya" organized by Croatian Chamber of Economy and the country's embassy in Libya during a visit of Libyan business delegation. Representatives of the American consulting firm AECOM and Lybian Housing and Infrastructure Board (HIB) made presentations about various infrastructural projects that involve construction of residential and commercial buildings, roads, schools, bridges, hospitals and airports, amongst others. Sam Talje from AECOM said that the goal behind this large investment is to transform the urban, economic, social and other life in Libya.  Amongst the projects are building the complete infrastructure for 68 cities, a construction of more than 120,000 new buildings, hundreds of kilometres of roads, highways, etc. The representatives of Croatian firms expressed concern that few of them had the resources to open an office in Libya, as they had been urged to do if they wish to participate in tenders. Another recommendation is that the company doing business in Libya hires at least 50 per cent of the local workforce. Currently there are nine Croatian firms doing business in Libya - Viadukt, Geofizika, Adriamar, Montmonta a, Crosco i TVD Sistemi iz Zagreba, BCDE Split, Diaput from Gospic, and air carrier TradeAir from Velika Gorica. About 500 Croatians work in Libya, but they are more expensive workforce than those that come from southern and southeast Asia, the portal Business writes.
