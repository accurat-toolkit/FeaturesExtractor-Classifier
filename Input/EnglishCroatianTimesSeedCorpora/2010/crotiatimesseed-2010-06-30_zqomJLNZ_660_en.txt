The alleged British connection in a Russian spy ring is the daughter of a former Russian ambassador who was expected to become one of the country's brightest business brains, it emerged today (wednesday) Friends of Anna Chapman - held on spying charges in New York - told Russian news website Life.ru how they expected her to become the country's first female oligarch, not a spy. Her father - says the website - is a career diplomat and was once Russia's ambassador to Kenya travelling the world protected by diplomatic immunity. And while her parents lived the political high life among Russia's elite, she was often brought up by her grandparents in the remote backwater Volgograd. "When she was in eighth grade of primary school her father used to be the Russian diplomat in Kenya," one former school pal told the website, revealing that she was born Anna Kushenko. After completing studies at the Russian University of People's Friendship, Anna entered the business world and joined the Fortis Investments company where she worked in property. Anna became a leading member of Moscow's Entrepreneurs Club, an association for young business brains on their way to the top. "I knew Anna for more than two years. Have they really held her for spying? I would never think that could have happened. "She is a businesswoman by nature. She was totally devoted to business. She used to work so hard. "I last saw her about a year ago in Strogino business park and we were talking about her latest project Domdot.ru ," one club member said. Other friends say she was once married to an unnamed British businessman and moved to Manhattan last February to begin working in luxury property rentals.
