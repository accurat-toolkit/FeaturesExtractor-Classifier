Poles watch more internet porn than Brits, Italians, French, and Scandinavians, and are the fifth largest audience of amateur sites RedTube and YouPorn, a study has shown. But psychologists say this is the result of poor sex education and not porn addiction. The research carried out by US group Alexa shows that Polish internet users are the fifth largest audience of RedTube, one of the largest porn websites in the world. RedTube is more popular in Poland than the social networking site grono.net, the Polish Railways site or a popular site with job ads. Bank worker Anna Nowacka, 29, admits: "Before work I have enough time to look at my favourite porn page. After work, I'll look again. Every day. "My partner watches porn too. We watch it separately though. I do not know what he likes but I like the group stuff," she adds confessing "Three years ago I discovered that sex on the Internet is more exciting than the reality." According to a report by sexologist Prof. Zbigniew Izdebski, surveying 10,000 Polish internet users, as many as 86 percent of them watch porn sites. In 1994, only every second Pole admitted watching porn, a report by CBOS showed. The fact that so many Poles visit porn sites does not mean that they are necessary addicted to pornography. "You are addicted when you lose control and, for example, spend someone else's money on sex calls," says Prof. Mellibruda. The Polish Society of Human Life Defenders, however, holds the opposite view. In their opinion, people who watch porn frequently put sex scenarios known from porn movies into practice, like American serial killer Ted Bundy who was fascinated with images of sex and violence. Prof. Izdebski thinks, however, that Poles' interest in pornography results from the lack of sex education. "People wrongly treat porn movies as educational material. Besides, they still think it is a forbidden fruit which tastes better," says Izdebski.
