Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor met with U.S. vice-president Joe Biden yesterday (Tue) during an official visit to Washington D.C. Kosor called her visit "the most important day of my political career" though she did not meet with the President Barack Obama as he was hosting the Italian president Giorgio Napolitano before heading to California. At the press conference following the meeting, Kosor thanked the United States for its support for Croatia's speedy accession into the EU and said: "The Republic of Croatia is going through the most rigorous negotiations for membership of the European Union and I am happy that we have shown readiness and the ability to resolve all obligations tied to the negotiations," she said. With Bosnia and Herzegovina as one of the main topics of the leaders' discussion, Kosor added that Croatia's entrance would be an added encouragement for other states in the region to follow. "That is important for final stability, peace and prosperity in southeastern Europe," she said. "For me as PM, meeting vice-president Biden is an extra encouragement on the way to realising the three pillars of my mandate: finishing EU negotiations, where we have full and absolute support from the US, fighting corruption, and achieving economic recovery," the PM said at the press conference after meeting with Biden. Before the meeting, Kosor gave a speech at the John Hopkins University and had a breakfast with Madeleine Albright, former American State Secretary during the Bill Clinton administration.  She is also scheduled to meet Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Deputy Secretary of the State James Steinberg, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List reports.
