A live TV auction for the virginity of a teenage girl has reached 75,000 GBP in just three days. The 18-year-old - identifying herself simply as Miss Spring from northern Hungary - was forced to cancel an earlier online auction when website eBay pulled the plug. She then withdrew from a 100,000 GBP bid by a British businessman because he told her he wanted the price to include marriage. Now Hungarian TV station Tabu is hosting the auction which will come to a climax later this month (Aug 25). "It looks like a lot of people are interested and hopefully foreigners will not be deterred by most of the interview being in Hungarian," she said. Miss Spring - who claims she has never had a boyfriend - added: "I don't think there is anything wrong with it. I'm only doing it to save my mother's home from being repossessed. "It's just for one night. And I think it's actually quite romantic because the man who pays me this money will be helping to save my family from being homeless. He will be our saviour. "I broke off with the British guy because he wanted to go too far. I'm not looking for a husband - I'm doing this for my family," she added. On the page http://tabutv.hu/szuzessegelado/english she writes: "Let's say a few words about me ... I'm 180 centimetres tall, I weight 75 kilograms, and I am 19 years old by this time. "I am clean, neat, and I don't have any infectious illnesses. I am virgin in every sense, and if the winner of the bid wants, I am open to prove this with being examined by a gynaecologist. "There are a few conditions about the deal: All bidders must be neat and clean. All I ask you is to be polite, kind and tender with me. I do not take any anti baby pills and I am afraid of venereal diseases, so using a condom is a condition too."
