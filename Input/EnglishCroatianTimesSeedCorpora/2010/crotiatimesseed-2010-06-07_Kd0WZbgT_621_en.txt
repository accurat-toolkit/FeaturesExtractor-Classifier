The Solidarity Fund (Fond solidarnosti) intended to provide resources for the return of refugees to integrate into their new countries, has still not been founded two years after the idea's inception. The foreign ministries of Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro again met in Belgrade in March this year to discuss the initiative, but little has happened since, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. Milorad Pupovac, the president of Serbian National Council warns that such delays could cost the former Yugoslav countries between 50 and 60 million Euros of international aid needed for the fund. "There are signals from the European Commission and United States of America that they are willing to help, but not enough has been done here.  We cannot lose any more time, because with such attitude, the states are sending the message that they do not deserve the offered aid," Pupovac said. "As far as Croatia is concerned, that could complicate its European Union negotiations as well as the relationships in the region," Popovac added. The Fund would consist mainly of foreign donations, which would be used for refugee integration or as assistance to those who planning to return to the homes they fled during the Yugoslav wars that lasted between 1991 and 1995. The funds could be used for renovation of houses, as support for small businesses and for infrastructural repairs. Three months ago, Belgrade signaled the need to count all the refugees and determine those eligible for assistance. But according to Zagreb, the definitions of refugees are a stumbling block. "Croatia wants - through UNHCR established methodology - to determine the exact number of refugees from Croatia who now live in Serbia," says Mario Nobilo, the Director of Multilateral Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration. Official Serbian records show 60,000 refugees from Croatia currently living in the country, a number that Croatia says is inflated.
