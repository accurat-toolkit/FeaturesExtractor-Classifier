Croatian shipyard Brodosplit in Split has given a Banko pneumatic grinder made in Croatia the highest marks. It is an innovation developed thanks to the financial and logistical help of the Business Innovation Center of Croatia (Bicro) and produced by the Split firm Banko. It was tested at the shipyard from September 2009 until November 2009. The advantage of the Banko pneumatic grinder is that it does not need to be lubricated, which means it always has a clean working surface and more environmental-friendly operation. Banko also has less vibration due to grinding at the speed of accessories. It has a competitive product price and high energy-efficiency. Brodosplit directors' praised the grinder yesterday (Thurs). Investment department head Nikola Mikacic said the grinder had been tested and used by the best workers who could easily judge the quality of a product. Banko company head Aljosa Boskovic said the grinder would be tested at other Croatian shipyards. Banko is also planning to promote it in foreign markets. At the end of February, it will take part in the international tool fair in Cologne. Boskovic said: "For one part of the European market, including Germany, we already have a distributor, but we expect other partners to contact us. During the year, we plan to increase production." Business Innovation Center of Croatia Managing Director Dalibor Marijanovic added the Banko pneumatic grinder was the best example of successful cooperation between scientists and the private sector. Bicro financed the project with 7.6 million kunas  (1.04  million Euros) and an additional 3.6 million kunas (0.49 million Euros) for prototype production.
