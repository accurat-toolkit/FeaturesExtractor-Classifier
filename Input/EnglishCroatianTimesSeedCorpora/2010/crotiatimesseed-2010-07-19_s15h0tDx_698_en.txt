Croatian and Serbian presidents Ivo Josipovic and Boris Tadic met over the weekend in Belgrade, on what was the first visit of any Croatian head of state to the Serbian capital since the 2006 dissolution of the Serbia-Montenegro union. While recognising that the road to the current good neighborly relations had been difficult and laden with problems, both confirmed their intention to push on in strengthening their countries' ties and cooperation. Included among initiatives put forward were the possibility for the citizens of both states to soon travel across borders with only ID cards instead of passports. Josipovic and Tadic said significant progress had also been made in the search and identification of those who disappeared during the war fought between 1991 and 1995 and added that cultural treasures looted during the war were also being recovered. Tadic also announced a visit to Vukovar, one of the places in Croatia most devastated by the war, and praised Josipovic's recent "peace tour" during which he visited locations where Serb, Croat and Bosnian civilians had been killed. Josipovic said that Croatia had already turned over to Serbia documentation of people who disappeared in Vukovar hospital as well as two concentration camps. The atmosphere between the two men was friendly, and both presidents addressed each other with the informal "ti," the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. The mutual accusations of genocide remain open, though. The question of Kosovo - one that has become a major point of contention during the last months of former Croatian president's mandate - was kept in the background during Josipovic's visit. This is the first time that a Croatian president has visited Serbia since the dissolution of the Serbia-Montenegro union in 2006 and the consequent independence of Serbia.
