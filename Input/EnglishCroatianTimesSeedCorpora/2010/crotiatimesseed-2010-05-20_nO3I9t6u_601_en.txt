Croatia and Slovakia are lacking mutual direct investments, said President Ivo Josipovic during today's (Thu) visit to Slovakia, expressing hope that such projects of mutual interests could improve the countries' economic cooperation. Josipovic and his host Slovakian president Ivan Gasparovic addressed the visitors at the Slovak-Croatian Economic Forum.  The Croatian president noted the decrease in trade over the last few years, influenced by the recessionary environment and only starting to get better since last year. EU analysts estimate that the Slovakian economic growth is the biggest in the Eurozone this year, Gasparovic said at the opening.  He also noted that the trade between Slovakia and Croatia has been growing consistently since 2003, but had fallen significantly in 2009.  Slovakia, however, is visibly recovering, he added. Two presidents emphasized the energy sector, trade of goods, capital and services and tourism as potential areas of interest for investments. Slovakian investments in Croatia currently total 25 million Euros and Gasparovic believes that this is below the possibilities. Josipovic singled out the possibility of connecting the countries' industries, in particular the Croatian manufacturers of auto parts with Slovakian partners.  He named company Koncar and the project of low-floor trams as well as Rijeka port that could be of interest to Slovakian businessmen for automobile exports. Slovakia is an export-oriented country, and its government has undertaken various measures to attract foreign investments: it liberalized the labour market, introduced single tax rate of 19 percent and in January 1st of 2009, it introduced Euro as its currency. After their address, the two presidents took a walk around Bratislava and Josipovic finished his first official visit to Slovakia, the Croatian daily Poslovni Dnevnik reports.
