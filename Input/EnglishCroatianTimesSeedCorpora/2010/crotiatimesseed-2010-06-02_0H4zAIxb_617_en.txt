The Croatian government has expressed its sadness over the loss of lives following Israel's attack on a humanitarian flotilla on its way to Gaza. "Regarding the Israeli military action, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MVP) laments the loss of human lives and sends its condolences to the families," Mario Dragun, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Croatian daily Jutarnji List. The MVP added it was necessary to avoid any further escalations and has called for an investigation in accordance with international standards. Meanwhile President Ivo Josipovic said he hopes the incident will not endanger the recently renewed peace process and emphasized the importance of humanitarian aid access to civilians in Gaza. As a member of NATO, Croatia has activated an emergency decision-making mechanism for the first time. Its representatives, however, were not expected to speak at the emergency NATO meeting that was convened yesterday (Tue). Croatia is in an unenviable situation, the Croatian daily Jutarnji List writes. On the one hand, the country feels responsibility towards Israel and its politics have always reflected that responsibility. On the other hand, Turkey is an important ally in the region with its influence on the reform processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and as a growing trading partner for Croatia. The attacked flotilla had been announced. It had consisted of merchant ships sailing under the Turkish flag. Turkey has condemned the raid. An anonymous source told the paper: "I am glad that we are no longer in the UN Security Council," which would have put Croatia in an extremely delicate situation, torn between Turkey and Israel. The majority of the Security Council members condemned Israel's actions, requesting an in-depth investigation.
