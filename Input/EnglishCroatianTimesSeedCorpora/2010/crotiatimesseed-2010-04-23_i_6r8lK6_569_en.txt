The far right Freedom party candidate for the Austrian Presidency has been caught on a YouTube video singing a song that was the unofficial anthem of the SS. The Nazi hymn "Wenn alle untrue werden" (When everyone else becomes unfaithful) was sung by Barbara Rosenkranz at a festival held in Austria in June 2008 and it has now been published in Austrian media. The song praises "Holy Germany" and spreading the message to the world. The far right made substantial gains in neighbouring Hungary in a recent election and the Freedom party led by Hitler-praising politician Joerg Haider is hoping to see similar success in the upcoming Austrian presidential election. Opposition politicians are now calling for Rosenkranz to be prosecuted for promoting and defending the crimes of the Third Reich - something which is illegal in both Austria and Germany. In the video torches were waved as speeches were given about about "Germany's beauty" and "our ethnic ancestors". Rosenkranz, a mother-of-ten, also complained: "Every whore gets celebrated and praised in the media, while mothers are invisible." The song at the end of the video was penned by German Max von Schenkendorf and became the unofficial anthem of Heinrich Himmler's SS. Rosenkranz is running for president in elections taking place this Sunday (25 April). The ultra-conservative MP has between between 12 and 20 per cent support in polls, while incumbent president Heinz Fischer - a former Social Democratic MP, president of the federal parliament and science minister - is expected to garner between 70 and 80 per cent. Rosenkranz was the only one of Austria's 183 MPs who voted against the EU's Lisbon Treaty in 2005.
