He looks like a toddler taking part in a doctor's check-up. But this patient wearing a nine-month-old baby's clothes is actually a 22-year-old man about to take a huge step on the world stage. Official medical records at Tong Ji Hospital in Wuhan, eastern China show that Wu Kang officially measures up at just 68cm tall, or just short of 2ft 3ins. Now Kang is applying to Guinness World Records to be formally recognised as the new holder of the world's shortest man title. The title is currently held by fellow Chinese citizen He Pingping who is 74.61cm tall, more than two inches taller than Kang. "We knew he was small but we didn't realise just how small until we started to look things up on the Internet," said his dad Wu Jianxiang. But now pint-sized Kang has a big decision to make. Medics say that doses of growth hormone could boost his growth rapidly and give him a more normal life in the future. Paediatrician Luo Xiaoping explained that Kang suffers from panhypopituitarism, decreasing the secretion hormones normally produced by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. "Although he is 22 years old, his height is about the same as a nine-month-old, and his bone age is the equivalent of a 1-year-old. It would have been better if he came to see me earlier," said Dr Luo. "But it is possible to reverse some of the damage with human growth hormone. He could grow up to 12cm a year," he added. Now Kang's family say they're leaving the final decision to him. "It is something only he can choose. Fame is tempting but he would dearly love to be normal for once in his life," said his father.
