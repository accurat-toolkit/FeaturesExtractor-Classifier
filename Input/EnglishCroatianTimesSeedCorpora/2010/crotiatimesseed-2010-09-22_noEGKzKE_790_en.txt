Don't mention the War - but Monty Python star John Cleese has revealed how he secretly loves German culture. After years of his telly alter-ego Basil Fawlty taunting Germany over World War II, the telly legend has told how he wants to live in the German-speaking heartland. Cleese's scene of hotelier Basil goose-stepping in front of shocked German tourists is one of the most watched telly clips in the world. But now the telly funnyman has confessed: "I always felt attracted by Austrian and German culture in a certain way." "I've always liked Vienna. I never saw so much theatre and music and so many museums anywhere else. I like the city's velocity and the food. It doesn't have the tackiness of other big cities. "I considered renting a small flat in Switzerland. I love being in Lyon, Strasbourg, Munich and Milan in four hours from there," he said in an interview with Austrian newspaper Die Press. But funnyman Cleese bemoaned the fall of England's "racist" middle class culture. "England changed much more than I did. We used to have some sort of middle class culture with an adequate amount of respect for education. "It was a bit racist - not in a mean way though, but still racist. "Some things have changed for the better. But it's not a middle class culture anymore, but a yob culture, a rowdy culture," he said. The telly legend - who lost more than 12 million GBP in his last divorce - has just signed up to become the face of bookies William Hill in Austria. But despite now promoting gambling, Cleese confesses he's not a big better himself. "I don't bet a lot. I don't have to do so on cricket or football because I don't need that extra kick - I'm engrossed in the match that much. But betting on a low level is fun and enjoyable," he said. But one bet he did fancy was calculating how long Piers Morgan will last as the successor to CNN talkshow legend Larry King. "I'd love to bet on how long Piers Morgan will have this job," he said.
