The number of abortions in Croatia has been falling in the last nine years, Croatian Department of Public Health statistics show. There were 10,417 terminations of pregnancies last year, 4,450 of them performed upon the woman's request. The rest were naturally aborted births (miscarriages) or abortions induced for medical reasons. Compared to some of the regional neighbours, Croatia is amongst the countries with the lowest abortion rates. There are 101.4 abortions for every 1,000 live births in Croatia, while that number in Czech Republic is 215.4, Germany 167.7, Hungary 444.6 and Slovenia 227.3. The director of Rijeka's KBC hospital that has seen more abortions last year (944) than any other hospital in Croatia  says that the dropping numbers are an excellent sign. "At one point we had more abortions than births, but today there are almost twice as many children born than there are abortions. We have a similar situation in Pula hospital. Education, and information about contraception, abortion and motherhood have certainly contributed to the drop," Dr. Herman Haller said. Commenting on the high number of abortions in his hospital, Dr. Haller said that there is no hidden information, and that all abortions in the hospital are legal. Some say that the numbers could be somewhat skewed if a large percentage of abortions is performed in private clinics, which are then not included in the official statistics, the daily Vecernji List writes. The large hospital in Split performed 21 abortions upon woman's request last year, while smaller hospitals in Sibenik and Zadar performed 123. The director of Split's hospital says that while precise reason for such a small number of abortions in Split is not clear, religion does play a part in making the decision. He noted, however, that the county's natality grew and that Split has had more births than deaths last year. Statistics show that most Croatian women who decide to abort either have no children or already have two.
