Croatian tennis legend Goran Ivanisevic has revealed his admiration for players Thomas Muster and Rafael Nadal. The 2001 Wimbledon champion commented on Muster's ambitious return to professional tennis, saying: "He was one of the best in the world. I was always impressed by his fighting spirit. (.) I admire him." Ivanisevic, who will clash with the 43-year-old Austrian in the ATP Salzburg Indoors' Match of the Legends on 20 November, told the Salzburger Nachrichten newspaper: "I couldn't imagine doing six hours of daily tennis training (as Muster currently does). But believe me - I'll be fit and ready to play a good match. I regard it as a big honour to play against Tom." Speaking about his relationship to the 1995 French Open winner, he said: "Tom and me were on the (ATP) tour together for many years and we became friends for life." Muster won 44 tournaments before retiring in 1999. He launched a comeback earlier this year. Ivanisevic won 22 career titles before retiring six years ago. Asked whether he was more impressed by Swiss ace Roger Federer or Spanish star Rafael Nadal, Ivanisevic told the Salzburger Nachrichten: "Nadal, because his game has more character and more physical than Federer's performances. Federer's game is inimitable and elegant, but I personally prefer Rafa." The 39-year-old also said he hoped to get to meet Niko Kovac and Red Bull Salzburg midfielder Nikola Pokrivac when coming to Salzburg to play against Muster, Austrian Times has reported. "Niko (Kovac) was the captain of our football national team. He's got a special status with the Croatian public. I don't know him personally, unfortunately, but I'd love to meet him."
