Companies bosses at Tombia from Split, Adris Group from Rovinj and Tankerska Plovidba were record breakers for monthly net salaries in 2009, weekly magazine Lider reports. The fat cat managers were paid between 69 to 82 thousand kunas (9,600 to 11,400 Euros) net salaries, which equals 14 or 16 months of work for the average Croatian employee. The average salary in Croatia last year was 5,311 kunas (739 Euros) and because of the crisis tax, its real value was two per cent lower than in 2008. The company Tombia has since then been bought by Zagreb Franck and had been closed, with most of its 120 workers being left without jobs. Adris Group has 23 managers that receive monthly salaries between 10 to 14,000 Euros. The CEO of Tankerska Plovidba Ivan Mustic said that the company is happy it maintained its standards in 2009 because the salaries of their sailors are a key factor in business efficiency and competitiveness. "We hire sailors on contracts with conditions that all other solid companies in the world offer. If our salaries were low, we would have greater fluctuation and our best cadre would leave," says Mustic adding the company hires around 1,000 sailors. The management has 153 employees with salaries considerably lower than those of the seamen. Mustic says that this year the market is recovering quicker than they had expected and that 2010 could bring even better results than they had planned, which means maintaining high income. Next on the list are Orbico Maziva, where five members of the management and 14 workers receive salaries were between 2,800 Euros and 5,400 Euros. In fifth place is consulting firm McKinsey, with the average salaries of their consultants last year ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 Euros, the Croatian daily Vecernji List reports.
