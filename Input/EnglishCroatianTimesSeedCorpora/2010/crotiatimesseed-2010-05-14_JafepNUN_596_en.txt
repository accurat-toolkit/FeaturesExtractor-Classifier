All privileged pensions greater than 3,500 kunas (482 Euros) will be decreased by 10 percent starting July 1st, the Croatian government decided at yesterday's (Thu) meeting. Only full war invalids will be spared the cuts and those whose monthly pensions are lower than 482 Euros. The government announced that it would also not touch Tupljak miners' pensions nor those of workers that had been exposed to asbestos. The government is hoping to save 250 million kunas (34.4 million Euros) this year and 610 million (84 million Euros) next year. In 2012 it hopes to save even more, or 620 million kunas (85.4 million Euros). The state pays out around seven billion kunas (965 million Euros) annualy to 180,617 privileged pensions. The government's move will mainly affect 510 former representatives and government members  whose average pension of 9,341 kunas (1,287 Euros) per month will be lowered by about 900 kunas (124 Euros). But the government will save the most by cutting the pensions of 68,630 war veterans who receive on average 5,611 kunas (773 Euros) per month. Just this year the government spent more than five billon kunas (689 million Euros) on veterans' pension and pensions for families of those that died in the war. The veterans' organizations said they too were ready to bear the brunt of the crisis and the government's economic recovery reforms. The president of the Community of Associations of Homeland War Volunteers Tom Kacinari said: "Of course we would have been happier had the pensions been increased, but the situation is as it is and veterans cannot be separated from the rest of the country." He added that the organisations were aware of the changes which were previously announced. Average veteran pension will be decreased by 500 kunas or 69 Euros.
