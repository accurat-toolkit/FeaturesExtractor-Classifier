With a moment of silence and a march through the city's streets, some 20,000 people commemorated Vukovar's sacrifice during the war of the 1990s yesterday (Thu). The Column of Memory procession started from the city's general hospital and proceeded through various streets. Some 20,000 people from all over Croatia and Bosnia and Heregovina participated. President Ivo Josipovic, Speaker of the Parliament Luka Bebic and Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor were also in attendance. Josipovic said that on this day of commemoration, all must remember those that had given their most valuable possession - their lives for the creation of free Croatia. "Vukovar and Croatia are turning to the future," Josipovic said. "They are turning toward the European Union and the messages of peace that come from here are important for a European Croatia," Josipovic said. The prime Minister Kosor said that everyone must asks themselves how much they are doing for the city that had been devastated in the war. "I think that everything that the government is doing in this moment - from the fight for economic recovery, to the big undertaking that is European union membership, but also the fight against corruption - is an answer to many questions about what must we continue to do," Kosor said. The mayor of Vukovar Zeljko Sabo used the opportunity to point out that much more needs to be done. "Regardless of how much has been done and how much has been invested until now, it is necessary to do much more to rebuild the city. If we continue with this tempo, we will need the next four to five years just to remove the consequences of the war," Sabo said.
