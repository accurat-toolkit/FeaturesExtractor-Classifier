A concert by high-voltage rockers AC/DC could have been more explosive than usual after experts called in to detonate a World War II bomb said they now believe there are more than a dozen other devices concealed underground. The specialist company called in to search for World War Two missiles beneath the airport where the concert by AC/DC is to take place say the heavy vibrations could set off the devices which need to be removed before the concert can go ahead. Officials in Wels, Austria, said the team now believe that at least eight 250-kilo aerial bombs are located at the site around four metres below the ground and but there are also several 10-kilo cluster bombs around two metres below the surface at the city's airport. Digging for the explosive objects will only begin now after the Easter holidays. City administration chief Bernd Spitzer claimed the work would not affect the time schedule of the concert. Australian rock legends AC/DC are set to perform at the airport - which is used for domestic flights and aviation training sessions - on 22 May. Around 80,000 people are expected to turn up for the gig which sold out within minutes. Environmentalists have also made a bid to stop the concert after they claimed last year that the performance would pose a risk to the second-biggest colony of curlews in the province and 200 pairs of endangered birds that nest on the ground. But local authorities managed to come to an agreement with the activists after promising 90 per cent of the airfield's area will remain undisturbed by the concert, while light and sound effects will be restricted to a minimum.
