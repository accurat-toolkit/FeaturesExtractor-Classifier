British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco International have increased their activity on the Croatian market in the last month in what is seen as an effort to challenge Croatian TDR - that currently holds 80 per cent of the market share. Japanese JTI opened a factory in Croatia last year and reached an agreement to place around 120 million-worth of its product on the Croatian markets.  The company has expressed hope that the market will continue to open up to foreign competition. The other two international companies have started marketing campaigns.  Croatian daily Jutarnji List reports that all have expressed hope that the new law on competition expected to take effect in October should lead the Croatian Competition Agency (AZTN) to implement stricter penalties for companies that indirectly obstruct the competition on the tobacco market. This refers to the largest Croatian tobacco manufacturer TDR that currently dominates the market. The new law that is in accordance with the European Union regulations, envisions fines ranging from one to 10 per cent of the total revenue of the company that restricts market competition. " Our products currently are not available on the half of retail locations in Croatia, and we believe that entering into EU will bring free market competition," Philip Morris has said. The CEO of TDR Davor Tomaskovic said that Croatia has no barriers for foreign competition. "All multinational companies have been present on the Croatian market for a long time, although they did not have a significant market share.  Their activities speak of intentions to seriously invest in Croatia," he said. Although the manufacturers do war through trade, he believes that this question should not be raised to the level politics, he told the Croatian daily Jutarnji List.
