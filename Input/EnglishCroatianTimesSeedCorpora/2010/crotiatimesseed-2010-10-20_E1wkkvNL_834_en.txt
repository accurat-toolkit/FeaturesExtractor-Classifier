A German who after witnessing the brutality of Nazi street attacks on Jews tried to kill Hitler using a bomb is to be officially recognised in his homeland for his bravery with a statue in his honour. Elser lived through the horrors of the First World War and when he saw the outbursts of anti-Jewish violence during the Kristallnacht, became convinced that the only way to stop a second war would be to assassinate Hitler. He managed to plant a bomb in the Munich B rgerbr ukeller brewery in 1939, which missed Hitler by minutes after he finished his speech early - but killed several other people. Elser never escaped because he was stopped in a routine inspection as he tried to cross into Switzerland shortly before the bomb exploded - and was found to have photographs of the brewery in his pockets. When the bomb exploded and the link was made, he was sent to Berlin where he was interrogated by the Gestapo - who tried to talk him into admitting it was a plot backed by the British. SS chief Heinrich Himmler then ordered him imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps where they planned to stage a show trial after the war showing British involvement in the assassination attempt. He was, however, executed in the closing days of the war when it was clear that Germany was losing and there would be no chance of a trial. The new memorial is to be 17 metres high, and made of steal. It will be a silhouette of his face and will be located on the Wilhelmstra e in the city centre of Berlin. The statue was designed by artist Ulrich Klages and will be unveiled on 8 November 2011.
