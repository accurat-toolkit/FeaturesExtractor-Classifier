Some 55,887 Croatians have lost their jobs since the beginning of Prime Minster Jadranka Kosor's mandate last year in July. According to the latest data from the Croatian Employment Services (HZZ), 304,479 people were out of work at the end of October this year. That is a 5.2 per cent increase from the previous month, or 11.4 per cent rise year-on-year. The current prime minister took over as the head of the government at a moment when the country's unemployed numbered 248,586, the daily Jutarnji List writes. Since then, the numbers have been increasing month to month, peaking this March at a record 318,658. According to some estimates, some 67, 286 people have been left without work since the beginning of the recession.  Labour market trends point to further deterioration of the situation, the daily writes. Analysts from the Economic Institute expect the number to peak once again in March there could be some 330,000 unemployed. Independent analyst Ante Babic says that none of the government measures that are being implemented will significantly affect the rise in employment next year. Rather it will be the recovery of Croatia's export markets that will secure any significant changes on the labour market. Labour market consultant Sanja Crnkovic Pozaic says that the rates of the increase in unemployment are "frightening" and akin to those at the beginning of the 90s. She estimates that the numbers will continue to grow in the upcoming months. "A clear government strategy on how to anticipate and stop these negative trends is lacking. I am afraid that we have become a seasonally-oriented economy," says Crnkovic Pozaic.
