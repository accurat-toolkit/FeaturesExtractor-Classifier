Although bank lending has increased this year, most new loans to firms are used to keep them afloat rather than making new investments, data shows. Croatian banks have lent 260.9 billion kunas of loans up to August of this year, which is 6.7 billion kunas more than the same period last year and 100 million kunas more than a month ago. Data from the Croatian National Bank shows that the lending in August has grown two per cent compared to the same period last year. It's structure also points to the fact that companies, just like the majority of citizens, need credits just to survive. Few are using them to start up a new investments cycle, the portal Business writes. The chief economist of the Split Bank Zdeslav Santic says that this year's increase in loans to companies is a consequence of increased needs to finance regular business operations. There are almost no new projects being financed, he says. While loans to companies grew, those to citizens stagnated and their annual growth at the end of July was 0.2 per cent, in large part due to citizens aversion to loans and high unemployment. Although experts expect that the statistics for the third quarter will show a growth in lending, these will be mostly short-term loans. They agree that macroeconomic environment necessary for growth of long-term loans is not present at the moment. In addition to client apprehension, banks have become more strict when it comes to risk appraisal, so it has become more difficult to obtain loans than it had been in "golden" pre-crisis days. Many also fear the continuation of the recession, the portal writes.
