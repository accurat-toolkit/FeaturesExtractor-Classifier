"Drinkopoly" is the name of the new Croatian game that has taken off to a very successful start in a state where every sixth person is an alcoholic. A brain-child of the two Croatian companies, "Drinkopoly" seems to have been flying off the shelves with several thousands sold just in the first five months since the launch.  The challenge of the board game is to stay sober enough to be able to complete all the given tasks. "We are very proud to have been able to create a product that has been conceived and produced in its entirety in Croatia," says Filip Smerdelj, one of the men behind the project realized through a collaboration of companies Kreativni Dogadjaji (Creative Events) and Sequoia project. But while the young people are going crazy for game, experts are worried about a potential growth of alcohol consumption. According to recent data, every third Croat drinks more than recommended. Especially concerning is that fact more and more young people are drinking, the daily Jutarnji List writes. Dr. Slavko Sakoman from the addiction clinic KB Sestre Milosrdnice warns that the game could encourage youth that normally do not drink to start doing so. "Predominantly teenagers will be playing the game, and there is no way to establish a system of control," says Sakoman. Drinkopoly is currently sold only in Croatia, but the developers are currently negotiating with potential foreign distributors. The rules of the game: Six players can play. Everyone starts with their pawns on the board, as in Monopoly. Players roll the dice. At each field, an alcohol-related task is performed. Some examples: "The girl with biggest boobs takes a short sip," "Simulate a favourite sex position with a player of your choice and drink a short one," "Take off three pieces of your clothing or drink five sips." The winner is the person who finishes the game sober enough to do all the chores.
