Toyota Motor Europe has announced it will recall 52,903 units of its third-generation Toyota Prius in Europe in order to modify the software used in the vehicle's Anti Lock Brake System (ABS). Toyota Croatia confirmed the recall would cover only the three Toyota Prius that have been sold in Croatia since October 2009. It said the recall was in response to reports of problems during slow and steady braking on bumpy or slick road surfaces when ABS is activated. The procedure will take approximately 40 minutes using standard equipment at all authorized Toyota dealers. Customers will be contacted by letter in the coming weeks informing them of the free of charge service. Toyota Croatia said there had been no accidents linked to the braking problem in Croatia. No other Toyota or Lexus models will be affected by the recall. An Austrian engineering firm claimed last week it knew how to fix the hybrid Prius cars' problem. Vienna Engineering said it knew what was causing the problem and had solved it with a hybrid braking system. Vienna Engineering's CEO Christian Wunsch said that although the firm's mechatronic braking system was not yet in production, the company was in talks with brake manufacturers and would welcome talks with Toyota. Wunsch said: "VE is seeking the right global partner for production of the mechatronic brake. We would gladly work with Toyota to find a solution. Toyota's reputation has been excellent over the last decades, and we are ready to help them back to the top." Shares in Toyota slumped to their lowest level for 10 months on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday, with concern about the safety of the company's vehicles. This latest shock for the Japanese carmaker - the world's number one - follows worldwide recalls of almost eight million cars due to floor mat and gas-pedal problems. That includes 1.8 million cars in Europe.
