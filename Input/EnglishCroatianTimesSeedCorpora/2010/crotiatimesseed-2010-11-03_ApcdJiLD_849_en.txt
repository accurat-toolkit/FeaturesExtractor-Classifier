The low-maintenance pop-diva Lady Gaga has demanded 500 kilograms of ice, four bottles of oxygen and extra locks on her dressing room as she prepares to take Zagreb by storm this Friday. Sanja Ajdinovski from concert organizer Lupa Promotions says that despite her appearance, the unconventional star is far from demanding. "She is actually pretty simple and does not ask for much," Ajdinovski told the Croatian portal Dalje. The singer has only asked for 500 kilograms of ice for the stage and four bottles of oxygen, as well as some extra locks for her already well-guarded dressing room. Lady Gaga is accompanied by a vast entourage which includes personal chefs. The team - bringing 70 tonnes of equipment for the concert - will be rolling into Zagreb in 70 trailers and 13 buses. With her sense of style and outspoken attitude, the eccentric diva has appealed to nonconformists the world over. "The point of what I do is to place my fans in a space where they can celebrate who they are. As a teenager I did not fit into any group and I felt like a freak." "All of those who feel like that have a friend in me," the singer said. Some of her more devout followers have sent in inquiries to the promoters ahead of the Friday's concert fearing that their Lady-Gagaesque attire could cause some trouble at the entrance. "We receive a lot of mail, amongst them one coming from a girl who will come to the concert with cans which will act as "curlers" in her hairdo. She was concerned that because of security measures she will not be allowed in," they say in Lupa. The organizers reassure the fans that they can express themselves, as long as they do not carry any potentially harmful objects.
