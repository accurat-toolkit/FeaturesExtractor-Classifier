What really happens? She led John thetruthnews.info 10/24/2010 What I said about 3 years ... &quot;With all the attention on bogus threats like Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, few have any idea that the sleeping dragon has awakened and close for comfort&quot; of my report, entitled The threat hidden in plain site ... dragon woke up 6 / 25 / 2007 Link down. I have known this is coming for many years, but I can not believe how fast this is happening and how it is played down to our idiots in government and media, it is really a sick joke, and it&#39;s not funny. What really happens? Gee I wonder why they all have moved from the United States, it is not only due to high taxes and controls, it is because of the fall of empires, get it? Most politicians and those with money are out of the U.S. is already set, and many people who know what&#39;s coming, but moved from this country, what does it tell us? It tells me to prepare and pay attention! This is a serious folk and all of the designs, this is done more and more countries throughout history, Germany (Balfour Declaration), Russia (Bolshevik Revolution), etc, now is our turn.
 Many blame our government and so I do, I blame them for not taking control, the fact is that they are not under control, and we basically have a virtual reality show, and that our governments. How do I see the only way out of this quagmire for the state to take control for themselves individually at this time or we are all on the fast track to ruin. We can vote either in or outside like me, they are not in control! See what&#39;s happening today, the complete looting of America to collapse, who is in control? watch the video below by clicking the money masters.

Lindsey Williams: dying globalist &quot;The outpouring of the Gut&quot; The plan to destroy America - Alex Jones TV 1 / 6 Lindsey Williams reveals new information about the bomb Alex Jones Show today. Williams, who was ordained a Baptist minister for almost 30 years, went to Alaska in 1971 as a missionary and the executive status accorded to him as Chaplain, he was given access to information that is documented in his book, The Energy Non-Crisis.
 In 2009, Williams said Alex Jones on the global elite plan to sabotage the dollar, the economy and destroy America by 2012. Kurt Nimmo Infowars.com 21st October 2010 Appearing on the Alex Jones Show today, Pastor Lindsey Williams provided additional details about the progress of the global elite plan to destroy America, consolidate financial power and usher in world government, and reduce mankind a slave class. The price of gas will rise to between $ 4 and $ 5 per gallon in the next few months. Lindsey Williams told Jones his source - described only as executive director of the Big Three oil industry who have traveled to the Bilderberger circles - was suffering from terminal cancer and &quot;spilled his guts to him&quot; about certain details of a globalist agenda being carried out. Pastor Williams said the world is now at a critical stage in the globalist takeover scheme and that in the next few months we will witness the following important developments.
 Watch Russia and China globalists plan to use China and Russia to strangle America and Europe and eventually reduce to third world status. Lindsey pointed out the importance of the main oil export agreement between Russia and China. &quot;China has reached a long-term deal to borrow 25 billion U.S. dollars to two Russian energy companies in exchange for an expanded supply of Russian oil, stressing that the world&#39;s No. 3 economy, using its financial muscle to block access to natural resources,&quot; said the Wall Street Journal reported in February. &quot;Russia wants to assure customers and find a counterbalance to its dependence on Western Europe.&quot; According to Williams, trade between Russia and China will not be implemented the world&#39;s reserve currency - the moment the U.S. dollar - and it will further erode the value of the dollar and speed up his death. In addition, the new store will probably be used for bribes in Europe pay higher prices or possibly lost altogether its own source of energy, provided that Russia.
 This prospect will become painfully obvious in January when Russia and Belarus did not renew the contract for crude oil export tariffs and cut-off of oil is threatening the European continent. China is now the world&#39;s largest energy consumer, after being passed in the United States. As China is becoming the preferred model for the 21st globalist century, our need for energy will come into conflict with the West. On 19 October, the New York Times reported in an aggressive stance on China resources. &quot;China, which is blocking the delivery of vital minerals in Japan in the last month, is now quietly halted a shipment of these materials in the United States and Europe, three industry officials said this week&quot;, thus exacerbating the already rising trade and currency tensions with the West.
