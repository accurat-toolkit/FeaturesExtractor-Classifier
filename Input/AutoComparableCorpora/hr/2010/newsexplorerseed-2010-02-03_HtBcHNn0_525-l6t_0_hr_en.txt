Someone who (now or have already re-) story about the gods, is not doing that anymore so completely uncontested as it was in the first half of our century, or in the higher circles of the time already Voltaire. These two hundred years of course the short period of time and maybe just a breather compared with the times in which the gods and demons respected. Surely even before Lukijan any spirits who mocked the gods, at least those other gods. But remained on their soil. Even in Augustine&#39;s time the gods were present, although he admits only a demonic character, or titanium. His request may be to create or maintain the world, affecting our sadanju situation in the core. When Nietzsche measured as Apollo and Dionysus, it is no longer mythological symbolism - meant the mythical substance. &#39;&#39;God&#39;&#39;enjoys a certain reverence, and when it does not appoint or tongue around it, more or less convincing whorl. But if something does not match the income from our here and now, I feel instinctively and insights at every stage.
 Accordingly formed a prayer. Nietzsche&#39;s&#39;&#39;God is dead&#39;&#39;to mean only can the epoch-making state of knowledge insufficient. In addition auktor contradicts himself again došašæem&#39;&#39;everlasting&#39;&#39;. Divine lives. When izrièu name, then most of us have in mind pretkršæanska deity or deities of a local character. Their temples are ruined, and of many formerly revered not know there is no name. The gods therefore death, but it does not say anything against their creatures and their realities. And the gods are included in our show. We can bring them, say prayers or victims, but not behind the curtain where they appear - they stay there in&#39;&#39;thing in itself&#39;&#39;. Due to such a deployment (&#39;&#39;Religion within the Limits of Reason&#39;&#39;) Kant once called to account as someone&#39;&#39;who is humbled kršæanstvo and who is dangerous Novator in religion&#39;&#39;(Prussian cabinet order in 1794. In). Cults are based on the hope of divine encounter, their task remains to raise the hope of certainty.
 The cult of man possesses all the more convincingly celebrates this knowledge to the celebrations in the paintings. In a city that would be close to eternal, the artistic work had become a sacred and the sacred arts. It was at this time is unattainable - hence the controversy about images may come to reconciliation, but not to results. In the eternal city of temples has since reached the timeless beauty of art to which relentlessly, yet vain sought. We must be satisfied through offered like grannies who honor a piece of bone as a relic. It extratemporal though we do not somebody else&#39;s. Since the departure point and time we go it: it accompanies us on a journey as the only luggage that can not be lost. It sheds light on us when we suffer and when life gives us his light touch. The word&#39;&#39;changes&#39;&#39;thank character Leopold Ziegler - as well as a discussion of worker immediately after it is published. The conversation we ran quite close to refuge above the chapel in Goldbach, in which, in good view of the lake, okreæemo these records.
 Changes the character of the gods means to change the display which are revered. So there are places that were still reputed saints, though they changed their religion. Perhaps nekoæ there appeared an angel, miracle happened. New temples were erected on the ruins of the old. They were going to be objective hodoèašæu, festivities, sacrifices and prayers. Prayers are always important, but say they are especially common here have been answered. Fighting Titans and the gods are sumraèje metahistorijski - those of nature and the cosmos penetrate into history. Run time can be assumed that the Titans were the predecessors of the gods and that they manage the chaos. After that comes the fact that the myth of the Titans allegedly created by the gods and pouèavali them. Their uprising shook the Mount Olympus - Zeus microfilm and expelled into the underground. But they are returning - rampant Prometheus, for example, in the guise of workers. The gods created from extratemporal; Titans operate and produce in time. They were more related to technique than art.
 Therefore the poet Hölderlin advised to dream and seek solace in Dionysus as&#39;&#39;Iron&#39;&#39;rule - but he knows he will return to the gods. In addition to determining umijeæe. Exponent is a number that stands above the base number and shows how many times that number can be multiplied (potentiated) itself. In the equation 2 3 = 8,&#39;&#39;2&#39;&#39;is the base number, an exponent of&#39;&#39;3&#39;&#39;and&#39;&#39;8&#39;&#39;result. The main number is also called the&#39;&#39;root&#39;&#39;and&#39;&#39;indicator&#39;&#39;exponent. The equal sign is the&#39;&#39;mean&#39;&#39;. Medium intermediates, it separates and connects the same time. In addition to botany. If the equation is transferred into a parabola, the basic number I see as the root, a sign of status as a tree, a proponent of a tree top. The result is a fruit. Care should be viewed primarily as a clean product, so regardless of the economic, aesthetic and moral assessments that are excelling. In addition to spelling. &#39;&#39;Exposing&#39;&#39;and&#39;&#39;away&#39;&#39;and&#39;&#39;interpreted&#39;&#39;and&#39;&#39;exposed&#39;&#39;. I get involved in a work, written work, to the smallest details of its disposition to question and expose it.
 Exposing&#39;&#39;the&#39;&#39;means&#39;&#39;retire&#39;&#39;to&#39;&#39;expose&#39;&#39;- above all in danger. Neutral point of view it is a&#39;&#39;highlight&#39;&#39;. This talent (ekspozicionalni) above is purely potential, but it still creates the facts. (Coincidence in the sense of Thomas Aquinas.) Depending on the place and people, such as labels them Kvae properties such as good and bad, beautiful and ugly. Samoudaljavanje still works on optics, and therefore the style - so we get not&#39;&#39;executed&#39;&#39;but&#39;&#39;participate&#39;&#39;in smaknuæu. As for the more transcendence. Exponential proportion to the acts and deeds setting the reputation that they cause. A lifetime of poetic or artistic works decides the base number, it is only their character. With biography. In life, everyone is more or less exposed. Some are wise to use their abilities, while others profuækaju, dissipate and undermine - among which is the right environment, modest HOUSEHOLDS. An individual can double the power of his, udeseterostruèiti - it does not change anything basically.
 His presence on the battlefield, Napoleon izjednaèavao with a hundred thousand people. He, however, failed due to the character, not because of potency. This is eminently true of Hitler. In addition to transcendence. There are meeting to force the question body and life - they open up a wide field of intelligence between the political and ethical discipline. Last meeting, with one death, one can not escape. There is absolutely everyone is exposed. Its potential to avoid the time and number. Becomes imaginary. If the individual, unknown to himself, using a base number of&#39;&#39;X&#39;&#39;, he exposes the infinite: X ¥. Only then can an individual becomes an&#39;&#39;indivisible&#39;&#39;as it says her name. That her powers prekoraèuje each measure and each grade, includes the hope that exceed the hope of heaven. Arts and cults surrounding wall and ukrašuju time, the sacrament of death, I slept with everyone. Tolstoy in describing the death of Ivan Ilyich describes a transition in which existence is no longer being kidnapped, but man it Denounces.
 Tom and Heidegger:&#39;&#39;Waiver is not taken. Waiver gives. It provides an inexhaustible force nite&#39;&#39;. Similarly Schopenhauer in his&#39;&#39;Studies in the indestructibility of our true beings death&#39;&#39;:&#39;&#39;For us, death is something negative and remains - the cessation of life, only she must also have a positive side to us, however, remains hidden because our intellect remains totally incapacitated understand it. From there, I guess we understand what death we lose, but not what gives us&#39;&#39;. No way does not take more than conjecture. The great thinker complains that we are losing the light just when it starts to flash a new morning:&#39;&#39;If a philosopher, meanwhile, thought it would on its own dying find comfort in the fact that then solve the problem that it is so often preoccupied, he probably will be as that which, when it was just the way it finds what he sought,&#39;&#39;Light goes out. Doing, however, that this is allowed dilemma. When a bright light flashes, it does not go out less light than it accepts in its flames.
 Nietzsche envisions a time gustoæe flash such that it will pass through a thousand years not only as a&#39;&#39;Day&#39;&#39;but as part of a second. So what extratemporal eats&#39;&#39;forever&#39;&#39;. Time is the wall of Hölderlin prison wall that will be demolished in&#39;&#39;the most sacred of all storms&#39;&#39;. If the room is a flower, on the flood of light will not fade, but will stronger flash: integrated. He is being cleared because the grandeur and beauty are not enough - that is why he is mortal. Pennies on the customs changed into gold - contribution to opening the door. Even after the shift tisuæljeæa will continue to expulsion from the history of man. Large symbols&#39;&#39;crown and sword,&#39;&#39;and still lose the meaning; baton changes. Historic boundaries will be deleted; war remains distorted, razviæe be able to become a threat to planetary and universal. Next century belongs to the Titans, gods and still lose reputation. Because they will be back, as always, and had done, seen cultish - 21
 century will be a link, that&#39;&#39;interim&#39;&#39;. Dieu to retire. God withdrew. We should not fool ourselves that Islam is allegedly izuzeæe: This is not a Superior Authority of his time, but rather that he is - a titanic speaking - an appropriate time. Titans othode income and as a natural force; them in the phenomenal character is represented in animals and humans. Hölderlin in&#39;&#39;Bread and Wine&#39;&#39;envisions their došašæe. On limits to their rule objašnjavajuæi them as&#39;&#39;interim&#39;&#39;. I think it is&#39;&#39;poor&#39;&#39;times, at a then distanced from God,&#39;&#39;the poet&#39;&#39;to sleep better. The do not exclude that in the meanwhile, takes something powerful, though violently. Coming to the&#39;&#39;heroes&#39;&#39;brass cradle and they are they just&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;similar to those of heaven. Last refuge - a dream, intoxication and oblivion - the poet at Dionysus. In this regard, Hölderlin entirely agree with Nietzsche. Schopenhauer observes the world as a playground of blind will, he is titanic - podèinjen though vjeènoj adventurous, but the transient nature.
 &#39;&#39;For all that occurs, it is worthwhile to fail&#39;&#39;. Darwin gave the answer to the question how is it that despite the blindness will occur incl creation.&#39;&#39;Then I guess the Taj Mahal was created by random spraying of stones?&#39;&#39;- Was a counter to it is set. Schopenhauer, who is also rejected Darwin&#39;s theory, his own sense of humanity in search shvaæanju, hence the inactivity. Timeless knowledge products cults and ideas, and especially paintings. He believed that one could come across Europe&#39;&#39;proèišæeni Buddhism&#39;&#39;:&#39;&#39;It would have to be some kind puèka metaphysics, religion&#39;&#39;. Ruskin:&#39;&#39;Finally, the task of art is the representation of divine action in nature&#39;&#39;. Convergence, therefore. While Hölderlin with fear looking in the direction of interim and Schopenhauer and the skeptièki pesimistièki susreæe with titanizmom, Nietzsche in it feels like home. In his fateful 1888th
 year notes that on 21 century recognizes as his spiritual domište. Sudden razviæe energy in the technical world corresponds with a growing emphasis on the will. Nietzsche&#39;s will to ratify characteristic is his attitude toward time. While Kant during one of the forms of dawn, for what Nietzsche has a character of unconditional reality. This position reaches the final point in the doctrine of eternal re došašæu. This teaching has so far wrong as I see it is not the fruit of knowledge, but belief. Oswald Spengler emphasizes the value that Westerners prescribed time. In addition the following specific forms of timing. From the time except Gothic Cross clocks are included in the equipment of church towers. Their sign nadjaèava and overshadows the earth. This razviæe he started about thousand years discovery zupèanog hours, which replaced the elementary classes. Our world among other things can be taken as time clocks: their accuracy and lifespan approaching perfection.
 Their rhythm, moreover, does not measure only the smallest and largest of the atom to the universe, but rather, for example, setting the daily motion of the engine. Quartz watches are elementary clocks back on a spiritual level. Country svlaèi jacket. The collapse of&#39;&#39;Titanic&#39;&#39;, his breaking of the iceberg, proroèansko is any sign or else only in myth. From this we conclude, inter alia, provides that in fact the word about the progress interimu - a phenomenon that has a beginning and an end. Of course I yet to know that trees do not grow to the heavens. Now it asks that the country would then look like - or&#39;&#39;what she wants&#39;&#39;. Seems to be at the end of this tisuæljeæa repeated apokaliptiène vision - they are now, according to the mood in the world, mostly technical in nature. Notwithstanding the fact astrologers anticipate spiritualization horrible. Accordingly, it expects Kristjan time the Holy Spirit, who appears as a third behind the Holy Father and the Son.
 And with it the Third Testament, which remains the treatment of uskraæena poets. If the interim looks like nepritajeno therefore and phenomenal ascent of Titan, then in this respect must be primarily the modification of the Earth as it is already proclaimed, and particularly in the form of disaster. Here are probably overestimates èovjekovo involvement and guilt. This ex negativo can conclude based on what he recently showed a nemoæan - even if not pouring oil on fire. Already two hundred years of the revolution that we are changing the world of nature and society, while technically pre-social impulses. Historically, the situation repeats what is already there so often, such as the discovery of weapons and tools - wars, migrations of peoples, the devastation of the landscape imprudent exploitation of forests and pastures. But the question is whether sufficient historical perspective and you stand to me maybe the end of history.
 A lot of signs suggesting the fact that a country&#39;s revolution and setting the surround world revolution. And that would be repeated, albeit in greater cycle, which is not measured by historical epochs, but the Earth&#39;s seasons. This is in terms of approaching the mythical Hesiod, and scientific Cuvierovu system. This perspective is increasingly accepts, and even gets to the popular. It should consider evaluating the proper meaning of the big problems like climate change, atmosphere, the number of newborn. Compliance statistics and resistance against the big Titan is unknown. Can expect not only losses but also surprises. For example, the new matter and forces in inorganic and new species in the organic world. Driving in the invisible can apply as a discovery of the continent. These are the natural razviæa which includes human aid. They are not interchangeable terms in the cult phenomena. With him are okonèava interim.
 And where there are natural forces izjednaèuju each other, it is not happening out of order. Begins to outline heraklovski, kentaurski and Promethean characters - and as the first characters of workers. The technique is his outfit. As a world language it frees trijarije (soldiers battle the Third Order) of cramming numbers and the alphabet, possibly from mandatory schooling at all. Learns the game and watching - the existential. Do not forget Gigante and Chimaera, they appear where they touch the boundaries of research and kicks them prekoraèivati, such as gene technology and nuclear technology. However, a growing spiritualization is very dangerous, but is able to counteract the destruction - such as war, svodeæi it on the exchange formula. He taught as a slave in the Game of Chess. If you cut down on the table, it sljeduje weird giant. States nor the world will not abolish the force, because it fits into the created world. The war turns into a police action or veæeg smaller scale.
 Because the atomic weapons monopolized, uprisings have no chance, but it will increase the terror. Progress techniques can be finished in magic. Converting thoughts into action starts with the EU to announce some fields, particularly in traffic. Not even a phone conversation is usually not as simple as it seems. Ramps on the basis fotoæelija, transplatanti, chimeras, impressions of the dead on the screen, etc. All the more biotopes on which to act, it hardly needs to move his hand. Such a state away from the history already, because a year. Nietzsche it was the&#39;&#39;last man&#39;&#39;predicted, and Huxley demonstrated in detail. Interim becomes frothy. In this regard, the felahizacija - survive without a historical consciousness and veæih request - live from today to tomorrow. Elite are fewer and moænije, because they reach a threshold at which the mind transforms. Titans live and operate in time. Their power confirms the eternal re došašæu.
 This eternity is not the end of time or time, but their infinite expansion. One cut, and their end is attained. Titans are not in need of prayer, work them speak. They are highly revered even though their name behind the action. So the more today said:&#39;&#39;Uranos&#39;&#39;already&#39;&#39;uranium&#39;&#39;. Neither plutonium, although it has power on earth does not belong in the Mount Olympus. The gods are not eternal, but timeless - the more prayers they submitted to fulfill earthly hope, but they probably fulfill beyond hope. Prispijeæe gods can imagine - but it can not calculate or predict. But they have to appear because there is no culture without gods. How naive and reasonable expectations are directed to appear before the high tide. Some phenomena can heat a thousand years of reflection and respond like an echo, but it eventually becomes weaker, so weak theology. Each prayer becomes more or less mortal speech. Therefore it is the strongest effect on the graves.
 Not even the poetry of the gods are not interimu appropriate time, their name is best neutralized. In accordance with the divine do not require any animal or human mask to reveal the high spiritualization. New mutation condition, naturally, and a new level of cognition. That would not lacking, because scissors are the sharpest when it starts to close. Ernst Jünger, Gestaltwandel (1993), Sämtliche Werke, Stuttgart, Vol XIX, 1999.
