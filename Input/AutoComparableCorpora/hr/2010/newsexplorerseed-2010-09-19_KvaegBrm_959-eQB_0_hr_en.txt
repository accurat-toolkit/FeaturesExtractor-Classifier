The army restored order and peace, and is extracted from the rubble the bodies of new victims. The city is slowly returning, and thousands of refugees who are still left in the midst of conflict, Christians and Muslims. Abdul Umar, crisis manager of the Red Cross told the BBC: &quot;about 17,000 refugees have settled in 16 reception camps. There are many wounded, many people have died.
