Djelic, however, reminiscent of last year&#39;s European Commission report on the progress of Serbia and its openness to investment from the Croatian, the assessment of how the Serbian investment in Croatia is very limited. Only within the past five years, including the first half of this, Croatian investors have invested in Serbia more than 210 million euros, a Serbian in Croatia, only 20 million. It is very surprising fact, taking into account not only such a high level of disproportionality, but also the investment of Serbian companies in other countries in the region. Even in Slovenia, which is a member of the EU and the population much smaller than the Croatian, Serbian companies investing much higher than in Croatia, said Djelic. It is believed that the delay in accepting investors in Serbia can be an expensive cost to both countries and to work on improving the status of Serbian investors in Croatia. In the future, he says, is of great importance will be the initiative of our company for a joint appearance in third markets.
 Djelic to comment in 2009. year, regardless of the crisis in Serbia, there was more than 1.8 billion euros of direct foreign investment. It is difficult to speculate what would happen if we signed an arrangement with the IMF, but it is obvious to us is the fact that we are on time, the IMF recognized as genuine partners in the struggle with the crisis is very helpful. In the first seven months 2010th in Serbia are foreigners invested 620 million euros as at the level of last year when it shuts down oil industry of Serbia as the largest of last investment.
