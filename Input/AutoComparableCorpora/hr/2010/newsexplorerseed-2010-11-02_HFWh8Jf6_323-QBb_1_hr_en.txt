The head of Israeli military intelligence Major General Amos Jadlin said that Iran has enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear bomb, and soon will have enough to make a second. His estimates coincide with estimates of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the UN. However, as reported by Reuters, any statements of Israeli officials on Tehran&#39;s nuclear program is of special value, because Israel has not ruled out military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities to prevent the creation of a bomb. Israel considers Iran its greatest prijtnjom by egzistenciju.Izrael as well as Western countries do not believe claims that Tehran is developing nuclear technology for energy production. Jadlin was speaking at a closed meeting of the parliamentary committee for foreign policy and defense, and his statement carried today the Israeli media, quoting anonymous participants of the meeting. For Jadlina it was the last appearance before the committee as the head of military intelligence services because he said a five-year term.
 He is in his presentation talked about the security situation faced by Israel and the region. &quot;Current Security and the slack is unprecedented, but should not be ignored that there are efforts in the area (some elements) to strengthen,&quot; he said. &quot;The next military conflict will be between Israel and other countries, but between Israel and two or three different fronts at the same time. It will not be something like what we are accustomed to in the Second Lebanon War or Operation firm lead, &quot;said Jadlin, alluding to the war against Hezbollah in summer 2006. and three days long Israeli offensive on Gaza which began in late 2008. year.
