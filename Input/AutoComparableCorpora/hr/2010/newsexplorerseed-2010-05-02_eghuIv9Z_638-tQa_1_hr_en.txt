Australia became the first country in which cigarette manufacturers on the boxes of their products will no longer be able to display your logo and brand. Standardized boxes will be made of white cardboard, and they will be printed in bold letters warning of the harmfulness of smoking to health. Name of cigarettes and the manufacturer shall be printed in letters smaller. Proposal of a new law on tobacco angered the producers, but the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the government is exactly what was the target because cigarettes kill people and not any &quot;cool&quot; product that needs to look attractive. This provision of the law goes into effect 2012th year. In addition, the new law provides for 25-percent tax increase on cigarettes so that by tomorrow morning box of 30 cigarettes on average, two Australian dollars (about 9 million) more expensive than it is today. Money to raise this tax goes directly into the budget for health. Rudd also said his government is planning a sharp campaign to discourage cigarette advertising on the Internet.
 In the fierce campaign against smoking, the government plans to invest 28.7 million U.S. dollars. Canadian cigarette manufacturer Imperial Tobacco Australia plans to break the law through the courts and to the argument that the branding of the product has commercial value and that their empty boxes with warnings only bring profits will fall because people will no longer differentiate their products from products of other manufacturers. Experts on intellectual property claim that producers will get slow and that it would cost the state more than three billion U.S. dollars in damages. Prime Minister Rudd tells them that the law will be written very precisely and that the three billion and not excessive in relation to the sum of 31 billion dollars, how much is spent annually to treat diseases that are directly caused by smoking. He also said that as a result of smoking each year die 15 000 Australians.
