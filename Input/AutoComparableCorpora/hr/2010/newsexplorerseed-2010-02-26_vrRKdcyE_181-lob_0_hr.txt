"It is very serious issue. Nobody seems to be responsible. Corruption (charges) should be investigated thoroughly as the Commonwealth Games are a matter of national pride," he said. The Shiv Sena member was supported by BJP members who demanded a separate discussion on the issue. Through another issue, Manohar Joshi (Shiv Sena) demanded a nation-wide ban on a book on Shivaji, written by American author James Laine. He said the book 'Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India' has created unrest in Maharashtra and other parts of the country. Though the state government banned the book in 2004, it was lifted by the Supreme Court. While the copies of the book are not available in Maharashtra, it should be banned by the Centre as well, he said. Kalraj Mishra (BJP) expressed concern over rotting of wheat lying in the open in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. While so many people go hungry, wheat continues to rot despite directive by the Food Minister to the official to make storage arrangement, he rued. Even the Supreme Court had felt that foodgrains, which were allowed to rot, could have been utilised for the poor. Prakash Javadekar (BJP) referred to shortages of fertiliser alleging that lack of clear policy has discouraged fresh investment in the industry. He took a dig both at the Food Minister (Sharad Pawar) and the Fertiliser Minister (MK Alagiri), saying: "Fertiliser Minister does not consider himself accountable to Parliament and does not come here, whereas the Food Minister is busy with International Cricket Council (ICC)." KN Balagopal (CPI-M) referred to the plight of national highways in Kerala, which have been damaged by heavy rains. He asked the Centre to release funds for repairing these roads.
