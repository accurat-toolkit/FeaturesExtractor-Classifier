&quot;We remain optimistic but be prepared for all possibilities including the possibility of fatalities after what happened,&quot; said local police commander Gary Knowles at the press conference. Director of the coal mine where an explosion on Friday morning Peter Whittall also on Monday morning, expressed doubts about the success of rescue operations. &quot;The truth is that we had no news since two people managed to get out of the mine. Families become increasingly difficult to offset hours,&quot; he told reporters. This is the first statement in which New Zealand officials are openly talking about the possibility that the miners killed in methane blast at a coal mine Pike River. These statements were a cold shower after the hope that the optimistic statements caused New Zealand&#39;s Prime Minister, John Keya on TV station Sky News. &quot;The information that are available indicates that there is oxygen in the mine and that all chances of the miners managed to reach the pockets of such influx of oxygen and are therefore alive,&quot; said Key.
 Since the explosion on Friday there was no contact with the 29 coal miners in Pike River, located on the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Rescue services are still not allowed to enter the mine because of high concentrations of gases that could cause an explosion. As estimated, rescue operations will not begin until Tuesday.
