Lately I notice more and more registrations from Macedonia on the main road and the City, means we are no longer so far it seems to me. First I was at the concert Leb i sol, and Maja from a window in the home reported an excellent itinerary from Macedonia -&gt; Macedonia, the sun and smiling people. I promised to send her the recipe for this red peppers Roge, which she managed to bring to the town from the Macedonia! To me the recipe makes a very tasty and easy-publish it here. Macedonian peppers Ingredients: 1kg red peppers - Horn 20 grams of cheese (I used half young, half izgratanog Trappist) 2 eggs Preparation: Filling Clean peppers, dry them. Mix cheese and eggs thrown. Fill a bit of pepper mixture, should not it be too much in each pepper. Now you can fry the peppers in oil (that&#39;s the original recipe), but I turned a recipe for a healthier version: arrange peppers on baking sheet in a tin oven.
 Bake for about half an hour, until the peppers do not &quot;relax&quot;. filled with pepper After frying them, can raise extra spice crust and whoever wishes, olive oils, honest, pepper. To me this is excellent. Bon appetit! roasted peppers
