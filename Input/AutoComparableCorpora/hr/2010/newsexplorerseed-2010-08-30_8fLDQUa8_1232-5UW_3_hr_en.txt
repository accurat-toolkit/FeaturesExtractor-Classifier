Certainly more sitting in front of television screens rather than in the cinema, but there is no chance that the award of television awards overshadowed film Oscar award. Yet, we really care what the TV series, shows, actors and directors the best in the world, and this in turn means that they won the annual Emmy Awards. Last night in Los Angeles &quot;Emmy&quot; divided 62nd time, a triumph as we know drama &quot;Mad Boys&quot; (Mad Men), which is the third consecutive time winning television golden statue! On the red carpet has triumphed and actress Christina Hendricks, and as a sex bomb! Its a light dress playing modern Web designed by Zac Posen overshadowed her grandly bust.
