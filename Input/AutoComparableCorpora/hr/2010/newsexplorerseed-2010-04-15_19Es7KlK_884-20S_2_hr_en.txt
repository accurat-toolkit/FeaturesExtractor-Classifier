Only when his speech began Jerzy Sniadek, leader of the largest labor union Solidarity - which was once the largest underground anti-communist movement - broke up a long, deafening applause. - All of us in solidarity, including the late President Kaczynski, have been ridiculed and derided for outdated patriotism, loyalty to God and country.

As soon as the parade with two coffin emerged from the basilica and slowly moved down the street Grodzka to determine Wawel (which is considered a national shrine in the field where Polish kings are buried, heroes and poets), people have made a row, threw flowers and kept applauding.

 This has been discussed on the streets of Krakow after the funeral. Anita works in a pizzeria near the main square and does not hide that it is a very controversial decision. - I know that is said about the late all the best, but I have one of those who believe that President Kaczynski should not be buried in a crypt wawelskoj. He is not no king, no marshal who was killed in the battle for a homeland. He was killed in an ordinary plane crash, it&#39;s a terrible tragedy, but not a reason to be elevated into a hero. We lost 96 people from politics, science, culture ... and i am on Saturday during the commemoration honestly cried. However, President Kaczynski has lived and worked in Warsaw, his family lives there and was supposed to be buried in Warsaw Cemetery Powazki. In addition, it was the best Polish president, was very conservative, even reactionary on many issues and does not deserve Cracow crypt. Was better Aleksander Kwasniewski, who has before him did two terms - said Anita and her colleagues.
 Either way, the impeccable organization of such a demanding event such as a presidential funeral para Kaczynski who was - in two three hundred kilometers from the city - saw off hundreds of thousands of citizens, with heavy protocol for political officials, clergy, military, policemen, scouts, journalists, and Of course, numerous national and international distinguished guests, Poles deserve praise.
