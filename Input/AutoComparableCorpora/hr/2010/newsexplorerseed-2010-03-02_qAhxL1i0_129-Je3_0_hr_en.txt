While they require some thinking time, the stock market want a quick response, and increased pressure on Angela Merkel, German chancellor, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French President, to approve the sale of debts before the problems of Greece spread to other European countries. Sale of debt could coincide with the efforts of Greece and the EU to agree on the measures by which the government in Athens could reduce the huge budget deficit. The two sides still can not agree whether the plan to reduce spending and increase taxes to hurl Greece&#39;s budget deficit is planned at nine per cent of GDP this year. WSJ carries a statement of high Greek officials said that his country is working on additional measures that it intends to meet this demand of the EU. Athens considers the sale of government debt in the amount of 20 up to 30 billion euros. That money is needed to make Greece pay off debts that fall due in the spring.
 Bonds worth 22 billion euros due for payment in March and April. The most vulnerable member of the eurozone this year has to borrow around 54 billion euros, and so far has raised 13 billion euros. Greece has discussed the possibility that next week, immediately sold debt worth between three and five billion euros. Even if German and French banks agree to buy half of the planned amount of 30 billion euros, it still means that investors in public bonds had to buy a large amount. (A)
