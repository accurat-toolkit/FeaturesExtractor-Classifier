Legislation of the House of France plans to declare unlawful wearing burka anywhere in public, which will include a fine of $ 140 for those who violate the law. For those who make their wife or sister to wear a burka stipulated penalties are even harsher. The proposal of this law will be on the agenda next week, before the vote of the Upper House - the Senate in September. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who supports the ban on wearing the burka, and is supported by other parts of Europe. Thus, the Belgian Lower approved similar measures, and the Spanish Senate narrowly managed to elect a majority to impose the ban on wearing burqa. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon has started a debate on the prohibition of wearing a burka last week at the opening of new mosque in the suburbs of Paris, when he declared that &quot;Muslim women who wear the complete uniform distort Islam, and show a black picture of sectarian religion.&quot; As for facts, research also shows that in France there are only 2,000 women who wear burka, and the police investigated and confirmed that most of these women do not enter into the stereotype of oppressed women, but to wear burka willingly.
 Police unions have expressed concern over the new law, because their members, as alleged, are not interested in forcing his wife to take off the burka. The other side of this whole story, of course, human rights and traditions and different interpretations of particular value system. In this regard, legal experts have already warned that the law prohibiting the wearing of burqa in all public places may annul the constitutional court. Add new comment
