After several unsuccessful attempts to fight with the oil leaking from the submarine sank below the source platform, today successfully placed a tube than a mile and a half, which should begin to remove the oil on the surface of the tanker. Although this is the first major success in fighting oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico that began foundering platform Deepwater Horizon in late April, experts say that considerable damage has already been done. Using a robotic submarine, BP engineers are in the pipe at the source managed to insert a narrow tube with a seal that should prevent the uncontrolled discharge of oil. They hope that something less than a quarter of raw material from a source end in the sea. The first attempt at setting up tube is not a good ending because they could not hit the hole from which spring tube leaking around 5000 per day of crude oil. For the next week announced a more ambitious action to combat natural disaster.
 According to estimates, up to now has been expired from the cracked source of at least five million gallons of oil, and computer models suggest that the oil slick has already arrived to the strong sea currents, which is why there was concern that contamination could have come to the shores of Florida. In addition, scientists warn of the underwater columns of oil which have been discovered in recent days. One such wide five and 16 kilometers long and located just below the surface until a depth of 1.2 kilometers. Apart from the obvious threat of pollution, such columns would be able to poison marine organisms, and must pull out all the oxygen. Source: Jutarnji.hr Related Articles
