Afghan President Hamid Karzai signed a decree on Tuesday about the complete dissolution of the &quot;contractor&quot;, private security companies that play a particularly important role in the international forces in Afghanistan (ISAF). Karzai&#39;s decree gave the period of &quot;four months to complete dissolution of private security firms, Afghan and international.&quot; This sector is developing very rapidly and now employs 40,000 people who work with international forces, the Pentagon, representatives of the UN, embassies, companies that manage billions of dollars of international aid, NGOs and foreign media. Karzai has criticized the security companies that employ Afghans, and he believes that they should fill the ranks of the army and police. He therefore called the staff of the Afghan security companies in the police, unarmed or with him. Foreign security guards, and they are mostly former soldiers responsible for training, visas will be abolished.
 From now on, the security of embassies and international and humanitarian organizations to take care of police and soldiers would escort a convoy to supply the international force. Providing convoy is one of the most important and dangerous task &quot;contractor&quot;. A spokesman for international forces, General Josef Blotz support the dissolution of the security companies, but only if the conditions have been met to the Afghan police and army take control themselves. It is believed, however, that the army and police will be ready to take care of the security of the country before the 2014th year. And the Pentagon, one of the largest enterprise customers&#39; security, is tacitly made it clear that the withdrawal deadline should be extended. (REUTERS / metro-portal)
