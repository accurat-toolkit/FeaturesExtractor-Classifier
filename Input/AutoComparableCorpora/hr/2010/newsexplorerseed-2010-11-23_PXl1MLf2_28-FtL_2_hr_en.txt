On the world&#39;s stock markets last week was a great uncertainty due to the Irish financial problems, the tightening of monetary policy in China and the strengthening U.S. dollar. On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average last week has strengthened 0.1 percent to 11,203 points, while the S &amp; P 500 remained unchanged at 1199 points and the Nasdaq index, which is &#39;frozen&#39; at 2518 points. At the beginning of the week stock prices have fallen sharply because of the debt problems of Ireland. In May the European Union had to step in to help Greece because of excessive budget spending, while Ireland has a problem with the cost of the nationalization of three banks that were found to collapse after the collapse of the local property market. The causes of financial problems in Greece and Ireland are different, but their impact on the market is the same: investors are afraid that the EU will have to step in to help Ireland. And not just her, smoldering similar problems in Portugal and Spain. Because the euro has been under strong pressure, so the early weeks of his course, for the first time in 7 weeks, plunged below the level of $ 1.35.
 The strengthening dollar has caused, however, a sharp drop in prices of raw materials, and because they found themselves under strong pressure from stock prices in the mining and energy sector. On the London Stock Exchange FTSE index index last week fell 1.19 percent to 5732 points. However, Frankfurt&#39;s DAX rose 1.61 percent to 6843 points and the Paris CAC 0.75 percent to 3860 points. The Tokyo Stock Exchange&#39;s Nikkei index jumped 3.1 percent in the week, the 10 022 points, the highest level in five months. Variable Week &quot;on the world&#39;s stock markets last week was extremely volatile. Emerged in the foreground are the debt problems of Ireland, and China&#39;s tightening monetary policy measures. The downward correction in stock prices occurred in part because the indexes have reached the top of the range in which the moving past year and a half ago, &quot;said Balgač. Strong momentum in stock prices at stock exchanges on Thursday Balgač rather evaluates reflex reaction of investors to losses since the beginning of the week rather than changing the negative trend.
 &quot;In the next short period, the mood of investors in global stock markets will continue to affect debt problems of peripheral eurozone and Chinese measures to combat inflation. Therefore, it is questionable whether re able to overcome the positive trend, especially because the most important stock market indices continue to move in a fairly narrow range, whose upper or lower limit or fail to penetrate, &quot;said Balgač.

 Technical Analysis: The reference point S &amp; P since 1170 points extremely volatile last week on Wall Street resulted in an increase in the S &amp; P 500 index by only 0.53 points to 1199.73 points. Euro exchange rate against the dollar is also extremely fluctuated, and at the weekly level remained almost unchanged at about $ 1.3690. When moving the Chicago Stock Exchange VIX index options the situation is similar in terms of trading volatility, but on a weekly level fell 12.5 percent to 18.04 points. &quot;The rejection of the preset resistance at 1128-1230 points, which represents 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement from the bottom in 2009. year to the highest point in history, S &amp; P 500 index started to descend fairly quickly, so that last week found support at the level where the original target was for growth markets are in early September. His initial target was about 1170 points, where the &#39;fat finger bounce back level&#39;, which is the highest point of the S &amp; P index to which they refused to prices immediately after the biggest one-day decline in more recent history, the American Stock Exchange, which took place in early May of this year, &quot;says Mark Erdeljac, head of retail trading in the company Erste ivnesticijskom securities.
 As stated, the Japanese know the techniques to analyze the graphs in the form of candles will notice that the trading last week formed a so-called hammer on the weekly graph of the S &amp; P 500 index. &quot;Otherwise, a very &#39;bullish&#39; candles, which at the end of the downward trend indicates a potential bottom, this time gives us a very clear message to the market, although the indicators &#39;overheated&#39;, still manages to find buyers. But as yet we do not find at the bottom of a downward trend, but within the growing trend that started in early July and September, last week the bottom of 1170 points gives a reference point on which to watch in the coming weeks, &quot;said Erdeljac. As long as the S &amp; P 500 managed to remain above that point of 1170 points, there is a great opportunity for renewed attacks on two major points of resistance that are on the 1205 and 1230 points, which would keep above them opened the way for moving the market to target zone of 1350-1380 points, according Erdeljac.
 In the case of market growth in the coming weeks and months, the key will be to follow the price movement of the U.S. dollar, ie the ratio of the euro and dollar. His move to the previous top of $ 1.43 to the euro would give force to re-stock bull market entry and growth of the S &amp; P 500 index, says Erdeljac. And the movement of the VIX, known as the &#39;fear index&#39;, could indicate the direction of the stock market. &quot;Any drop in VIX and below the threshold of support for increased 18 points to bullish sentiment and gave the space growing S &amp; Ps. However, the growth of the VIX and the rejection of these limits would put the focus on equity markets this week&#39;s bottom of the S &amp; P and at 1170 points, &quot;said Erdeljac. If a lowering of the S &amp; P 500 index below 1170 points, the strengthening U.S. dollar and an increase in the VIX index, the focus of investors would bear scenario, a point of support for S &amp; P-in, there would be at 1150 and 1120 points and the most important ones in 1070, or 1,000 points concludes Erdeljac.
 Correction or the beginning of turning &quot;The main question is whether this rise of dollars just a correction in the broader trend of the weakening U.S. currency, or to start turning. If this means that the dollar eventually stabilized and solid stops on both legs, I think that is before us perceptible price correction in the stock market, and raw materials, &quot;said Bill Strazullo, strategist at Bell Curve Trading. Commodity prices were under pressure and because the expected tightening of monetary policy in China, which has problems with high inflation and strong growth in lending. On Friday, the Chinese monetary authorities have increased the isolation rate bank reserves, the second time in the last two months. It is possible, say analysts, that China will soon raise interest rates, if these measures are not sufficient. And that would scare investors, could slow the growth of the second-largest global economy and weaken demand for raw materials, given that China is their biggest importer.
 However, mid-week eased the pressure on stocks, largely thanks to the hope that it will solve the financial problems of Ireland, after the eurozone agreed to cooperate with the EU delegation and the IMF. Help, which could reach tens of billions of euros, has offered to Britain, whose banks were major buyers of Irish government bonds. Therefore, the exchange rate euro rebounded against the dollar, which has positively affected the prices of raw materials and stocks in the mining and energy sector. Thus, Wall Street recovered from early losses on the week. However, technical analysts warn that the S &amp; P 500 index failed to break above the key level of 1,200 points, which could mean that by the end of the year to move in a narrow range. &quot;At the level of 1,200 points appeared to be a strong selling pressure, while the level of 1150 points on strong buying pressure. In this narrow range of S &amp; P 500 index could move up further, &quot;said Joe Battipaglia, strategist at Stifel Nicolaus company.
