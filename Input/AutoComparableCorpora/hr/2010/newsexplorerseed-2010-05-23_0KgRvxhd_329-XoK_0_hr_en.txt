Portuguese experts raised Helenio Herrera When 13 years ago, 9 November 1997. The Helenio Herrera died in Venice, the creator of the famous football &quot;lock&quot; and the last winner of the Champions Cup with Inter 1965th year, said: &quot;See you in my next life ...&quot; And indeed, Herrera is risen! &quot;Met&quot; we have these days, Helenio Herrera was revived in London, Barcelona and Madrid in the form of Jose Mourinho, the coach who invented the bullet-proof door lock and toughest 21st century. &quot;Locksmith&quot; is tossed back and Chelsea and Barcelona and Bayern Munich. &quot;Herrerin&quot; ghost riding again, this time in the form of Jose Mourinho, with the strongest defense except the Portuguese, who has ever walked on football fields, and created a lightning quick counter attack, which &quot;kill&quot; opponents. I remember a collision Chelsea and Barcelona at Stamford Bridge, in the 19th minute it was 3-0 for Mourinho. The attack played today insignificant Damien Duff and Mateja Kezman ... England will again wonder Mourinho: &quot;It is really very far for an interpreter.&quot;
 Will admire him for information that perfectly speaks five languages, however, whether the world admire his football. His next stop was Real Madrid. Will pay him 15 million euros, just to humiliate hated Barcelona, in which I&#39;m not sure. &quot;The coach and players, who have not played or coached Real Madrid have not achieved anything in his career,&quot; said Mourinho, but I&#39;m not sure it will succeed this time. The world is aware, Inter club champion of Europe, Jose Mourinho is the best coach, Ivica Olic is the second best scorer of the Champions League, scoring one more than Diego Milito. But even in a sparkling mood intelligent coach like Mourinho will know that the best football played Barcelona and Barcelona is the best team in the world, and Leo Messi is the best player in the world. With all the compliments Cristiano Ronaldo, Higuain and Diego Milito, with whom Mourinho will next year try to break the dominance of Barcelona, which won &quot;masterful tactics&quot;, but with ample judicial assistance in Milan and millimeters, who shot Bojan Krkic odgurali next door to &quot;Camp Nou&quot;.
 I&#39;m afraid football and soccer modernism, which offers Mourinho. It is clear as day that otherwise could not succeed against Chelsea and Barcelona, but Mourinho will be a defensive style installed in Real Madrid, it will again collide with the &quot;enemy of the enemy&quot;, Barcelona. All coaches will be the world&#39;s football craze &quot;mou-language&quot; style of football which will return in time Helenio Herrera. Because the result is the &quot;mother of all battles&quot;. A front man of such style is just Jose Mourinho, whom I adore because of all its properties, except that football game, and when one Eto &#39;oa forced to play shooting ... Bayern in this duel, which, we admit, Inter played great, had no even the slightest chance. Even if the English referee awarded a penalty kick for the Bavarians, and even that Olic scored his chance, would eventually triumphed again football Jose Mourinho. Bayern had only one player, which can be measured with the Inter player (Robben).
 Unfortunately, Bayern has the &quot;wrong&quot; Muller, the famous and Gerd to this, the retirement age respond better than their latest (and worst) copies. From such Bayern, which has allowed Mourinho &quot;žuganje&quot; the middle ground, &quot;wise&quot; Louis van Gaal has been pulled and Altintop, who is not a worthy replacement for Ribery, but it&#39;s still better than most of the Bavarian players. Although Bayern lost, Ivica Olic of Croatia entered the &quot;Hall of Fame.&quot; He is now just as valuable and significant as the Cup winners and Champions League, Robert Prosinecki, Alen Boksic, Zvonimir Boban and Davor Suker. His 7 goals Juventus, Manchester United and Lyon earned him immortality in the history Bayernovoj in the hearts of Croatian fans, though it will be this summer in South Africa and although it is not lifted the cup with big ears. Ivica Olic is the glory of fame more than the entire Croatian Parliament, all ministers, business owners and entrepreneurs &quot;, is one of the few Croats, whose name is pronounced today in Europe with respect.
 With Robben was Bayern &quot;lampaš&quot;, which is the strongest light for ... The phenomenon of Jose Mourinho over me &quot;tickled&quot; than the World Cup. What will you do with Kaka, the leading Brazilian player, who in his drawings there. Or will the Brazilian still be his Spanish Sneijder? And how long will endure in the real? I am confident that Barcelona will find the answer to his game. The Real Madrid will have Maicon, Lucy, Samuel, Zanetti, Cambiasso and Thiago Motta. There will be no Carvalho, Terry, Ashley Cole, Lampard and Drogba, without the type of player who works hard to Mourinho. New Real will be the biggest mystery and the biggest lure Mourinho. But he already has a backup position. He stated that &quot;a return&quot; in the Premiership. I doubt he will return to Stamford Bridge, although it is Roman Abramovich remained the &quot;one bound the Champions League.&quot; I am convinced that the goal at Manchester United after Alex Ferguson went into retirement ... and I thought of something.
 You&#39;ve probably realized that Diego Maradona is not quite sane. And do not be surprised if at the World Championships in Argentina&#39;s striking set is not the hero of the final match Militta Diego. For Maradona is untouchable Messi, Aguero and his son-&quot;crazy&quot; Tevez and Higuain. Easily it can happen that Maradona Milittu assume Messi and Aguero. However, this has already been riddles from South Africa ... Source: Jutarnji.hr Tags: Herrera, Mourinho, the winner, trainer
