Pope Innocent III wanted to check and sent a special legate to Bosnia Split Archbishop Bernard and the pope&#39;s chaplain, John de Casamaris&#39;s. During the Parliament on Bilino Field (near Zenica) dne 08.04.2003. Pope&#39;s legacy is found in the faith of the Church of the Bosnian Christians no &#39;heretic&#39; eccentricities, and Nemanja suffered a failure with his plan to get hold of the position of the Big Ban of Bosnia, and that - on both sides of the Drina and the two empires at once! But to heal suspicion Eastern rulers Basileios, Nemanja was sent after the coronation of his son, King of Raska, in Constantinople his younger son Rastko to the Ecumenical Patriarch arranged things in the religious field the Eastern Patriarch Stefan Prvovenčanog acknowledged as king in religious matters is given Christians of his kingdom a special church autonomy. Sitting on two chairs, and not only in the religious field, Raska received her specific church - Catholic, but the Eastern rite.
 This status is maintained to this day only Cantons Zeta or Montenegro. In political terms, Serb who came to the Balkans from Western Sibirije as allies of the Avars (Porphyrogenet v. K.: &#39;De administrando imperio&#39;, cap. 29), were the first Basileios, Heraclius received wars devastated the area in the hinterland of Salonika, where they established their thematic Serblia and where to spread its power in the surrounding countries - via Macedonia, Lower Dacia, Dardania and later Moesiji. However, as Constantinople acknowledged that State Supreme Court Building authorities, in order to obtain the status of political independence, had to call the name of your country - Serbija. That is, how to record Dr Šišić, at that time was generalized phenomenon of political terminology stvaranih state on the ruins of the Roman Empire (VND: Dr FS, p. 76). NB Raska, truth be told, it was never about a &#39;Serbian land&#39;, that it would be inhabited by ethnic Serbi due to the Asian region.
 About it openly and officially said &#39;Orthodoxy&#39;, the official organ of the Serbian Orthodox Church: &quot;And we, as Nemanja, we unite the country, and struggling on how to unite and soul njinih population, let us be firm and state dugoveka. Everything just like it is today higher than at the time of the Sava and Nemanja. Nemanja is purebred, Zećana, Humnjana Nerentani / Narentini and made the Serbs, and we still strive to be on time, the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and many others, create a larger, Yugoslav People&#39;s unique ensemble &quot;(&quot; Orthodoxy &quot;of 22.01.1970, art. &#39;on Saint Sava&#39;). It should be fair to pay tribute to the objectivity of the writer of these lines in &#39;Orthodoxy&#39;. Here it should be said that Nemanja coined a new plan - to get the Pope to consent to his son Stefan crowned King of Raska. Pope (at odds with Byzantium) to that agreed and sent the royal coronation props to the King of Raska Stefan Prvovenčanog. Mention here that one of the most beautiful monasteries in the Raska designed and built by Franciscan, Fr Vito from Kotor, which proves that all Nemanjići were Catholics of the eastern rites until the &#39;Dušanova Code&#39;.
 In fact, in many kingdoms were formed and disappeared various dynasties, empires, but the survival of a new dynasty were held everywhere, including the Eastern Roman Empire. The so-called NB. The Byzantines never called themselves are not &#39;byzantioi&#39; but always &#39;romanioi&#39;. When the Byzantines found squeezed due to penetration of the Turks over the Marmara Sea in an open intention to occupy Constantinople, there was a crisis of choice is the new Byzantine emperor on the throne vacant. So how are the Serbian court schemer followed developments in Cargradu, took into account that Stefan Dušan was the son of a charwoman of the previous dynasty, came up with the idea of Stefan Dusan Deals - Basileios in Constantinople. Specifically, Stefan Dušan&#39;s sister married a Bulgarian King Ivan Alexander and this act made the Serbo-Bulgarian alliance with the aim to overthrow the then Basileios in Constantinople and brought to power the Slavic branch, ie the Eastern Roman Empire to become - a Slavic empire.
 On the occasion of the death of Andronicus III Basileios Paleologus, was not clear who should inherit it. His elder son John Kantakuzen barely had seven years, in the tradition of Constantinople never a child is not crowned the ruler&#39;s successor. However, with this young heir has emerged as a pretender to the throne Basileios Aleksis Apokaukos. In this messy military ally of the Serbs and the Bulgarians had already arrived by car and went to Constantinople, where the outbreak of the rebellion. The Imperial Palace was burned and the patriarch was proclaimed himself the ruler of a peaceful solution of pending court &#39;revolution&#39;. The situation has calmed down and John was crowned as Basileios John V. But, unable to resist the growing intrigue surrounding the throne, John decided to retire to a monastery. In the confusion of Serbian court has added to his side one more intrigue. After Stefan Dušan made in prison to strangle his father, Uroš III., He was named archbishop Joannicius Serbian Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and this, in Skopje (some say Ohrid) Stefan Dusan was crowned the &quot;emperor Srbljem, Grkom, Bulgarians and honored .
 Well you could sit back on the throne in Constantinople basioeiosa, Dušan are solemnly pledged to govern &#39;according to Greek traditions and laws. &quot; No &#39;Emperor Dusan&#39; going no further than the Macedonian cities of Seres and Prilep, where he died in 1355 in the 48th age. From caricatures of the &#39;reign&#39; has remained ballast - incomprehensible content &#39;Dušanova Code&#39; and the behavior of the Serbs that it is still sticking. In this crucial respect it happened is what Nemanjina Kingdom Raška definitively extinguished, and that is not lit the flame Serbian domination in Constantinople. Thus, this diverse nation found itself - and to this day remained - even in the East or the West. The end in itself, but always possessed a strange tendency to the holders the right to conquer neighboring countries and made an empire that was and still is obsessive mania - &#39;vascelom world gives lessons in religion&#39;, politics and morality. No matter what the Nemanjići expressed deeply loyal to the Holy See in Rome, the Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church issued a year 6857 (the eastern calendar) year before the death of Dushan (year 1354), &quot;Law blagovernoga Emperor Stefan, flight 6857, indikt second, the holiday of the Ascension of the Lord, the month of May.
 21 days &quot;- short &#39;Dushan Code&#39;. Note again, that this &#39;Dushan Code&#39; and still in force in the Serbian Orthodox Church and that all the reality in Serbia and around Serbia (in the twentieth century and the world going by team our time of incomprehensible code. How and why? Regardless of what the &#39;svetorodna dynasty&#39; was born from the blood and keep the blood (Nemanja killed his brother, a &#39;car&#39; Dusan hand of his father), Serbian patriarchs are considered true destiny Routers Serbian religious and secular authorities. There rulers, willy-nilly, play a subordinate role. And even though the Pope sent a crown and scepter Raška Nemanjina son of Stefan the First Crowned, the &#39;Dušanovo Code&#39; is in black and white, that the territory of the Serbian lands prohibited activity of Catholic priests, and those who refuse to cross the Serbian faith are provided drastic penalties. Cl 6. &quot;Dušanova Code Catholic church and its members simply called&quot; Latin heresy &quot;(Art.
 7). Should any member of any other faith dwelt among members of the Serbian faith, that he has a burn mark on his face, and the prognosis, and if to hide that it is - burn (Art. 10). Inovjercima was ordered to immediately turn to the Serbian faith, otherwise there&#39;s to be punished as stated in the law of the holy fathers&#39; ie, physical torture (to cut his tongue and cut off the hand (Art. 26). &quot;Dushan Code&quot; is still mid-fourteenth centuries, had its own &quot;race laws&quot; directed against the Albanians and Vlachs (Cl.83). If through an Serb village passed a Arbanas, he may not keep it, and if he would be joined by anyone, must be fined. brutal punishments await Eastern Bogomils that &#39;Dushan Code&#39; called Baboon. Just the mention of their names have to be sanctioned by fines (Art. 86). No one in Serbia can not have anything to do with foreigners or receive them in your home if it car does not explicitly approve (Art.
 129). In vain would seek any explanation of the behavior of those who belong to the Serbian church, and that does not take into account the requirements of &#39;Dushan Code&#39;. The Code exempts the Serbs from the whole human race. In the process of disintegration of Yugoslavia Serbian theorists are themselves called &#39;heavenly people&#39;. Bishop Lucian on Serbs, on the eve of the fall of Vukovar in 1991, called &#39;saints&#39; and stated that &#39;all acts of his sanctifying&#39;. A prof. Dr Biljana Plavsic went so far as to claiming that the Serbs &#39;genetically incompatible with the Muslims&#39;. Marxist theoretician of world renown, Mihajlo Markovic said, in November 1991, that &#39;Americans humiliate the Serbs when they are forced to live together with Muslims in Bosnia. &quot; Serbian religion as a thing that theists and atheists ... The complex relations between the Serbian existence of faith and their places of worship in the course of five centuries of Ottoman domination, their behavior varied according to the Muslims and other Christians.
 Living mingled with the Muslims is what the Serbs who had converted to Islam, they retained their ostracistički relationship only to Catholics. Even when they found themselves in exile in Catholic countries, they are his dislike for the people who hosted them and even helped them to have their own churches, and publicly exhibited. Indeed, along the borders of the Ottoman Empire, they were defending the territory of the Ottoman Empire. During the Second Battle of Kosovo, 1448, Đurađ Brankovic was on the side of the Turks, and his daughter Mara was in the harem of Murad II. in Istanbul and how these influential people. He even captured the leader of the Christian army Sibinjanin Janka (Janos Hunyadi) and keeping him in prison in Smederevo, demanded a ransom of Croatian Hungarian court. It is particularly interesting case of Michael Latas, Lika the Orthodox and the Austro-Hungarian officer, who, for stealing money garrison, fled to - the Turkish side, arrived in Banja Luka and there converted to Islam.
 When the Bosnian Muslim, Husein-captain, 1850th, raised the Bosnian Muslims to arms to resolve the Turkish oppression and liberate them from the despotism of his homeland, Bosnia, Michael Latas, who is well acquainted with the Austro-Hungarian military tactics and strategy, moved to Islam, Omar Pasha, and he arrived at the head of the Ottoman military units and hit a powerful military force in Bosnia Ustasha. As a reward for success in a fratricidal war, was given the rank of Marshal of the Turkish. NB The Omer Pasha landed nobles Herzegovina - Smail-aga Cengic and beg Stocanin. Husein-captain is hoping to help their &quot;Christian brothers&quot; from the surrounding areas, especially Slavonia, but got no help. When after the crash, fled to his &quot;Christian brothers&quot; in Slavonia, which is in its eastern part was devoted to Hungary, Christians have him extradited Ottomans. He died a broken spirit and body in a Turkish prison in Trebizond. The truth should look with both eyes and realize that they are Croatian territories that have adopted the culture madžaronsku always looked on Bosnia - sole.
 Since the German emperor Friedrich III, in 1448, to unbreakable podvojio Bosnia and split his power to undertake all of Bosnia, he was, that would weaken the king Tomas, Duke Stephen gave the title &quot;Herceg of Saint Sava&quot;, whereupon the Bosnian Cantons Hum called Herzegovina. In all historical critical situations Bosnia was the most vulnerable in its south-east. However, despite all the attacks and betrayals, Bosnia, Bosnia has become, Bosnia Bosnia - Other! Here we have a completely new term - the Ustasha. This term originated back in the fourteenth century and before the fall of Bosnia under Turkish. When, in fact, the Bosnian Ban Large and then king Tvrtko I. Kotromanić, son of Princess Bribir, he decided to escape the Hungarian aggression and constant tužakanja the Holy See, that members of the Church of Bosnian Christians &quot;heretics&quot;, he created a large all Croatian Hungarian League Against nasrtljivaca and took the title &#39;king of Croatian and Dalmatian. &quot;
 He entered the league Tvrtkovoj Zagreb Ladislav Lučenac ban, ban Ivaniš, Prior Palizna Vrana, Bishop of Zagreb, Horvat brothers and a number of nobles from the Croatian areas of Bosnia around. On the Hungarian side was slavonski Gorjanski magnate. This feat Tvrtko League described the August Shenoa in his novel &quot;The Curse&quot; and the novel is named Shenoa Tvrtko members of the League - the Ustasha. The name &#39;Ustasha&#39; appeared in Bosnia on several occasions during its long history. Ustase the mass occurred in Bosnia and the collapse of Uprising Husein-captain, especially on the eve of the Congress of Berlin. The head of the Orthodox Ustasha in Krajina was called. Peter Mrkonjić (future Serbian king Peter I. Karađorđević), and led the Catholic Ustasha was, the Franciscans and Kresimir Saric, and my great grandfather John aka Pandživuk. It is, in Krajina forests, where vrvjelo of wolves, to encourage his fellow colleagues who have moved mostly at night, with his bare hands grabbed the wolf and - broke his bridle.
 Those who knew John, he claimed that no one is allowed to look in his eyes - his gaze on to defeat anyone who finds himself in front of him. During a meeting between Orthodox and Catholic Ustasha, somewhere near Šipova, there was competition in the power and skills at our folk tradition. So were the two leading men should be reflected in wrestling. John was more agile. In Herzegovina, headed by local Ustasha then fought, and Luke Vukalović Vaso Vidovic. The feat was described by the then Ustasha August Shenoa again in his book &quot;Thunder of the Gabela. A special chapter in this epic takes the complex relations between Ban Jelacic Square, the founder and organizer of the modern Croatian army which was, in the totality of the military forces of the Habsburg monarchy, thanks to the great Ban Jelacic had designated a special, special command in the Croatian language and special regional costumes. The totality of forces Jelačić Croatian army was little more than 51 117 soldiers.
 At the same time in Lombardy has been in positions for about 30,000 Croatian soldiers. As Ban Jelacic Rajačić established the Orthodox Patriarch, in the hope that the Orthodox and the unit, the Patriarch&#39;s invitation to join the Army Civil, Jelacic tried the diplomatic way to win over Croatian Orthodox against the Hungarians and the Croats. Patriarch Rajačić is, at a meeting of Parliament on the eve of Ban&#39;s visit to the Hungarians, openly demanded that the Croatian Sirmium found within the Province as a separate political entity will not be under the jurisdiction of government in Zagreb. Against this were all the Croatian Parliament, especially Bishop Ožegović. Ban is, of course refused, noting that is occupied &#39;Croatia has long been the only Croatian counties&#39;, and &#39;Sirmium was never a part of Serbian Vojvodina&#39; (vnds 116) which gave them the Hungarians, but at the expense of the Croats and so misplaced origins Croatian-Serbian conflict of interest &#39;, which will hugely Hungarians only cost about seventy years later! Ban&#39;s main military command &quot;for the homeland and the King&quot; in the ranks Jelačić Croatian army, reduced to a greeting: For home - ready! The totality of Croatian Army troops Ban Jelacic Square, before crossing the Drava river and falls in Hungary, there were volunteers from Bosnia.
 Ban was aware that Hungarians are great adepts husari frontal collision with opposing force, and established four special &quot;Ustasha Battalion, for an entirely new - guerrilla tactics: When activated by heavy artillery fire on the main part of the entrenched enemy, and placed the army, four battalions of the Ustasha were supposed to hit where the greatest confusion reigned, but not all at the same time. And when the germ chaos in enemy ranks, then a frontal war becomes unfit for odpor on multiple fronts at once. But when, on this occasion, incurred the general chaos in the ranks of enemy troops husarskih, then they need to hit the major forces and defeat them or compel them to flee.
