The prize worth ten million kronor (1.09 million) were for achievements in the field of linking carbon atoms to molecules, or to work on so-called combination of palladium catalysed in organic synthesis. &quot;Their discoveries and work in many ways to improve our daily lives,&quot; the magazine said the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in Stockholm. Bildunterschrift: Großansicht des Bildes mit der Bildunterschrift: Catalysts Imitation processes of nature three scientists whose work will primarily promote the development of new drugs and new types of materials (primarily plastic as used for example in the electrical industry), it has managed something that nature already produces itself: a combination of carbon and organic molecules, which in turn, depending on the structure and complexity, capable of taking even the most complex tasks. These &quot;connections&quot;, for example, found in the sea, in algae, sponges and shellfish, and their biggest secret, and the potential lie in the fact that out of them can &quot;create&quot; new types of drugs, since their natural composition of antibacterial and antiviral.
 In other words, three scientists have found, or found a way to convey this natural process in the laboratory and the result of working out must be equal to that of nature. Bildunterschrift: Großansicht des Bildes mit der Bildunterschrift: Akira Suzuki, one of the winners, a professor at Hokkaido University in Japan without a patent fact that they are this year&#39;s laureates of the Nobel Prize was not surprised almost nobody. Even I-Ei-ichi Negishi reacted relatively relaxed saying that &quot;many in advance about whispering to me the news is not so surprised.&quot; What is in some ways it is surprising to note that Japanese scientists said that until now these findings are not patented or that they they do not intend to register and protect them. &quot;On the contrary, is in our interest that our findings remain accessible to as many people as possible to maximize their use and areas where it could use,&quot; said Ei-ichi Negishi-.
