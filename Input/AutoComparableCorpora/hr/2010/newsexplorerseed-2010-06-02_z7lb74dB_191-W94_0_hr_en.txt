European leaders warned yesterday that the debt crisis could spread beyond the borders of Greece, and Moody&#39;s Investors Service has announced the possibility of reducing the credit rating of Portugal. Investors are concerned that the Greek government will fail to implement the measures planned budget savings due to union protests, in which three people were killed yesterday, and the weakness of the economy. They fear, too, that other financially weakened eurozone member states such as Portugal and Spain, the European Union will have to help even greater amount of 110 billion euros that is intended to Greece. Because the euro is under strong pressure, so his course yesterday sank to $ 1.2805, its lowest level in 14 months. The strengthening dollar has caused, however, the fall in prices of raw materials, so the price of oil, after a long period of time sunk below the level of $ 80 per barrel. Therefore, among the biggest losers yesterday were stocks in the energy and mining sectors.
 S &amp; P index of the energy sector declined by 1.5 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.54 percent, zaroniv≈°i at 10 868 points. Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 fell 0.66 percent to 1165 points and the Nasdaq composite 0.91 percent to 2402 points. (REUTERS / pd)
