But there remains my word that the nuclear program and ultimately does not matter but it is important to state that Iran&#39;s constitution is based on the Islamic revolution.

Several officials said it was strictly confidential analysis, written in January for the president&#39;s national security adviser Gen. James Jones, a part of intensive efforts within the Pentagon, the White House and intelligence agencies to develop new options for president Barack Obama.
 They include a series of military alternatives, which have been elaborated, which would be discussed in the event that diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course, says NY Times. Officials familiar with the contents of the memorandum were willing to describe only the parts that deal with strategy and policy, not the parts that are obviously engaged in covert operations against Iran, or access to American allies in the Persian Gulf. One senior official, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memorandum, described the document as a &quot;wake-up call&quot;. In the memorandum, Gates outlined a number of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy if Tehran chooses the direction that many analysts think likely - that Iran could obtain all the main parts for nuclear weapons - fuel, the formal solution of arms and detonators, but stop before the assembly of a fully operational weapons.
  By Gates continually begs the question whether Iran will become nuclear force at the beginning of what this creates a contradiction to what Iran says it will not go away to produce nuclear rouzje that nuclear power was even mentioned, and the religious laws that Islam is haram to produce nuclear oruzje.Znaci there is room for agreement and compromise to avoid war in Iran. Only it is essential that Iran has a last line of the red line that would be willing to go to war if someone would threaten the Islamic Revolution in Iran. I&#39;m musliman.Svi Muslims are brothers.

There is only one way - Siratul-mustek Today on earth there are three kinds of people: Disbelievers, Ahl as-Sunnah and the Muslims munafici. Munafici say they are Muslims.
 However, their iman and worships have no means certain similarities with the Ahl as-Sunnah.

Just try not to over their backs, if they have a rocket car that is right will not wallow Joking aside, but American paranoia has no limits it seems, if they decide to attack Iran will attack it, and without this assessment no matter how they sounded.
