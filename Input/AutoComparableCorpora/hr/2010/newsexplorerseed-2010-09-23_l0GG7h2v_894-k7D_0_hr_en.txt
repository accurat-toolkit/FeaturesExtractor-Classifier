Spinosaurus (&quot;thorny lizard&quot;) is a genus of dinosaur teropoda who lived in present-day North Africa, in the Cretaceous period, from before 106-93500000 years. This genus was first discovered in Egypt during the 1910-ies, and described by a German paleontologist Ernst Stromer. [1] These remains were destroyed during the Second World War, but has recently discovered another material. It is not yet clear whether there are one or two types. The best known species is S. aegyptiacus from Egypt, but is found in Morocco, another (possible) species, S. maroccanus. Spinosaurus was perhaps the largest of all carnivorous dinosaurs, even larger than Giganotosaurus and the tyrannosaur. Estimates which were published in 2005. and 2007. year indicate that the debt was between 12.6 and 18 meters, and was between 7 and weighs 20.9 tons. [2] [3] Spinosaurus skull was long and narrow as in today&#39;s crocodiles. Recognizable spine spines Spinosaurus, which were actually extensions of vertebrae, were at least 1.69 long we probably were associated skin, so the emerging structure similar to the nucleus, some authors have, however, suggested that they were covered with muscles that are so formed a hump.
 Deliberately is more a function of this structure, including thermoregulation and courtship. Spinosaurus was probably walked on two legs most of the time, but maybe sometimes it walked on four. It is believed that eating fish, there is evidence that he lived in water and soil, as today&#39;s crocodile. Contents [edit] Description Spinosaurus is known for his elongated skull, size and its nucleus or grbi. [Edit] Skull Head of S. aegyptiacus muzzle was narrow with straight conical teeth on which there was no serration. He had is six to seven teeth on both sides of the front upper jaw, in premaxillai, and another twelve in the maxillae and behind it. The second and third tooth on both sides were much larger than other teeth premaxillae and thus formed a space between itself and the large teeth in the maxillae, large teeth in lower jaw were inserted into this space when the jaws were closed. Top of the muzzle, where were these few large teeth was expanded, and there is little krijesta sight. [2] Using the three dimensions of the specimen by the name of MSN Messenger V4047, UCPC-2 and BSP 1912 VIII 19, and assuming that part of postorbitalni skull specimen MSNM V4047 had a shape similar to part postorbitalnom lubnje Irritatora, Dal Sasso et al.
 (2005.) Estimated that the skull of Spinosaurus was 1.75 meters long [2] The reconstruction of the skull length Dal Sasso et al.-is questionable because the shapes of skulls among spinosauridima may vary among species. [3] The restoration of S. aegyptiacus [edit] Size Since its discovery, Spinosaurus was a competitor for the longest and largest teropoda. And Friedrich von Huen (1926. Years) [4] and Donald F. Gluta. (1982 years) [5] it was in their surveys ranked among the most massive teropode, because about 15 feet long and weighing more than 6 tons. By Gregory Paul in 1988. was also chosen as the longest teropoda, with a length of 15 m, but he estimated that his weight was lower, about 4 tons. [6] Dal Sasso et al. (2005.) Assumed that the Spinosaurus and Suchomimus porporcije had the same body in relation to the length of the skull, and how they calculated that the Spinosaurus was a long 16 to 18 meters and weighed 7-9 tons. [2] Estimates Dal Sasso et al .- a were criticized because the estimates of the length of the skull were disputed, and (assuming that body weight increases with Cuba body length), measuring Suchomimus who was about 11 feet long and weighs 3.8 tons, Spinosaurus would have a weight of 11 , 7 to 16.7 tons. [3] ratio of selected giant teropoda, S.
 aegyptiacus is red. François Therrien and Donald Henderson, in an article in 2007. years, measuring the length of the skull challenged previous estimates of the Spinosaurus, as they felt that the length was too big, too small a weight. [3] On the basis of skull length from 1.5 to 1.75 m, could be a long between 12.6 and 14.3 meters, with body mass from 12 to 20.9 tons. [3] The lower limit of this estimate indicates that the Spinosaurus was lighter and shorter than Carcharodontosaurusa and Giganotosaurus. [3] Estimation Therrien and Henderson has been criticized for election teropoda used for comparison (eg most teropoda used to set the initial equations were tiranosauridi Carnosauria and members, who are built differently than spinosaurida) and due to the assumption that the Spinosaurus skull could be only 1.5 m long [7] [8 ] Improvements in the accuracy in estimating the size of the Spinosaurus require more complete remains, as in some other dinosaurs. [9] [edit] Sail or arms very long spines that grew out of Spinosaurus vertebra formed the &quot;nucleus&quot;.
 The lengths of these spines are more than 10 times exceeded the diameter of the vertebrae from which they were grown. [10] spines were slightly longer at the end than at the beginning and were similar to a thin &quot;šibama&quot; Edaphosaurus and Dimetrodon, but neither were as thick as the iguanodonta Ouranosaurusa. Spinosaurus sail was unusual, although some other dinosaurs had similar structures, as well as listed pticokuki Ouranosaurus, who lived in the same region as the Spinosaurus several million years ago, South American Sauropod Amargasaurus may have had a similar adjustment to the vertebrae. Sail is perhaps analogous to the nucleus sinaspida Permian Dimetrodon, which lived before the dinosaurs ever to appear; such similarities are due to parallel evolution. The structure may have been similar grbi, not sail, as in 1915. The stressed Stromer (&quot;someone might have more liked the idea of the existence of a large hump with grease, which they supported spikes&quot;) [1] and 1997.
 The Jack Bowman Bailey. [10] In support of this hypothesis, &quot;buffalo hump&quot; Bailey argued that the Spinosaurus, Ouranosaurusa and other dinosaurs with long spines on their backs, and spines were relatively shorter and thicker than pelikosura spikes (which are known to they really had a nucleus); instead, a long dorsal spines were similar to dorsal spines of extinct species with arms like Megaceropsa and types of Bison latifrons. [10] [edit] Classification Spinosauridae? Suchosaurus Baryonychinae Baryonyx Cristatusaurus Suchomimus Spinosaurinae Irritator Angaturama? Siamosaurus Spinosaurus Spinosaurus is named after a family of dinosaurs, Spinosauridae. Other members of this family are Baryonyx from southern England, and Irritator Angaturama (which is probably synonymous with Irritator) from Brazil, Suchomimus from Niger in central Africa and perhaps Siamosaurus, that people only known from incomplete remains of Thailand.
 Spinosaurus is the closest to Irritatorom, who, as he has nenazubljene, real teeth, two of them are classified in the subfamily Spinosaurinae. [11] [edit] Discovery and name [edit] History Artist Spinosaurus first described remains of Spinosaurus were found in the Bahariya Valley in Egypt, 1912. year. Name them in 1915. he gave the German paleontologist Ernst Stromer. [1] Additional incomplete remains from Bahariyae, including vertebrae and limb bones of the past, Stromer in 1934. was described as &quot;Spinosaurus B&quot;. [12] Stromer felt that they were sufficiently different to belong to another type and it was confirmed, after more expeditions have found more material is considered to belong to any Carcharodontosaurusu [13] or Sigilmassasaurusu. [ 14] Some Spinosaurus fossils were damaged during transportation to the museum in Munich (Germany), and the remaining bones were completely lost due bombrdiranja 1944th
 years by the Allies. [2] Named Two types of Spinosaurus: Spinosaurus aegyptiacus (Egyptian lizard with spines &quot;) and the Spinosaurus maroccanus (Moroccan lizard with spines&quot;). S. maroccanusa described by Dale Russell 1996th as a new species based on the length of the cervical vertebrae. [14] Russell claimed that the ratio of length Centrum (the main part of the vertebra) versus the height of the articular facet was 1.1 in S. aegyptiacus, and 1.5 for S. maroccanusa. [14 ] Later authors have separated in this connection. Some authors emphasize that the length of the vertebrae can vary among individuals, and that it is not known who actually cervical vertebrae were found in S. maroccanusa copies, therefore, these authors consider that S. maroccanus nomen dubium (questionable name). [2] [ 13] [15] In contrast, other authors have considered this kind of valid. [11] [16] [17] [edit] The examples described six major incomplete copies Spinosaurus.
 This copy, neodrasla unit, was destroyed in World War II, &quot;during the night of 24/25 April 1944. In, while the British bombed Munich&quot;; building in which the fossils were found was badly damaged. [18] However, others are detailed drawings and descriptions of this specimen. The material consisted of the following (mostly incomplete) parts of the skeleton: the left and right sides of the mandible and spleniali (small bone that exists in reptiles, amphibians and birds) from the lower jaw, 75 cm long, straight portion of the upper jaw, which has been described, but not drawn; 20 teeth, 2 cervical vertebrae, seven dorsal vertebrae; križnična 3 vertebrae, 1 caudal vertebra, 4 chest ribs; gastralium. [1] Of the nine kralježnih spines whose length is given, the longest was 1.65 meters long [1] Stromer&#39;s son donated his archive Paläontologische Staatssammlung München 1995th , and Smith et al. analyzed the two photos holotipičnog Spinosaurus specimen (BSP 1912 VIII 19), which is in the archives okrio 2000th
 year. [18] Based on photographs of the lower jaw and the entire photo set of the skeleton, Smith concluded that the drawings Stromer in 1915. somewhat inaccurate. [18] in 2003. Oliver Rauhut suggested that Stromerov Spinosaurus holotype was a &quot;chimera&quot; because it consisted of a vertebra of a family member who Carcharodontosauridae was similar Acrocanthosaurusu and the lower jaw of a large teropoda similar Baryonyxu. [19] This analysis was rejected in at least one subsequent paper [2]. 50 791 NMC, middle vertebra of the neck, 19.5 cm long from Morocco, holotype Spinosaurus maroccanusa, as described by Russel 1996th year. [14] Other examples are in the same article attached S. maroccanusu were two middle vertebra of the neck (NMC and the NMC 41 768 50 790), the front part of the lower jaw (NMC 50 832), the rest of the central part of the mandible (NMC 50 833) and the front of the dorsal vertebrae (NMC 50 813). [14] The fossil jaw of S.

[20] They described him Taquet and Russell 1998th , the copy is a wide 13.4-13.6 cm. [20] Taquet and Russell believed that this copy along with part of premaxillae, two cervical vertebrae and a dorsal vertebra, belongs to the type of S. maroccanus. [20] BM231 (in Collection Office National des Mines in Tunisia) are described and Buffetaut Ouaja 2002nd year. [15] consists of the front of the lower jaw, which is 11.5 cm long, was found in the formation Chenini. This copy is &quot;extremely similar&quot; to the existing material of S. aegyptiacus. [15] UCPC-2 (in the paleontological collection of the University of Chicago) is composed mainly of two narrow nasal bones connected together with a bump in the region between the eyes. [2] This copy , which is 18 cm long, was found in Morocco 1996th
 year, Cristiano Dal Sasso and it is 2005. was described in the literature [2]. Maganuco Simone, another author of Dal Sasso et al.

MSNM V4047 (the Natural History Museum in Milan), which is 2005. was described by Dal Sasso et al., consisting of the muzzle (premaxillae, partial maxillae and incomplete nostril) is 98.8 cm long. Proneđen in Morocco. [2] Other known specimens consist mainly of the very incomplete remains and scattered teeth. These include the following: [edit] Habitat Palaeoecology Spinosaurus was only partly excavated and covered much of present-day North Africa. One study of Moroccan fossils in 1996. The results showed the Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Deltadromeus &quot;inhabited North Africa during the late Cretaceous period.&quot; [26] They Spinosaurus who lived in Egypt today are likely to inhabit the rivers and lakes and mangrove forests, along with other dinosaur predators of similar size , Bahariasaurusom (which is perhaps synonymous with gender Deltadromeus) and Carcharodontosaurusom, sauropods and Paralititanom Aegyptosaurusom, 10 meter long crocodile Stomatosuchusom and teleost fish Mawsonia. [27] [edit] Paleobiologija [edit] Function sails or bumps reconstructed skeleton neodrasle individuals with genuine fossil remains.
 The function of the sails, or hump of the dinosaurs is unknown, scientists have set up several hypotheses, which are related to the regulation of heat and courtship. In addition, such a prominent feature on the back it could do more than it is horrible and the other animals. This structure may be used for thermoregulation. If it was a lot of blood vessels, Spinosaurus sail could be used to absorb heat. If this is true, then the animal may have been only partially warm-blooded, at best, and probably would have lived in places where the nights were chilly and the sky where there was usually cloudy. It is believed that the Spinosaurus and Ouranosaurus lived in an early form of the Sahara Desert, or on its borders, which could explain the above assumptions. It is possible that this structure is used to release excess heat, and not for its collection. Large animals because of the relatively small body surface in relation to the volume have much greater problems with heat loss than in its collection.
 Sails on the back of large dinosaurs have much contributed to the surface of the skin on their body with a minimal increase in volume. Furthermore, if the sail is turned from the sun, or when they are set at an angle of 90 degrees to the cold wind, the animals would be very efficiently cooled to a warm climate Cretaceous of Africa. [28] However, Bailey (1997.) Felt that Sail collect more heat than it laid off. [10] He instead suggested that the Spinosaurus and other dinosaurs with elongated vertebrae had bumps filled with grease for energy storage, insulation and protection against heat. [10] Unusual structures on the bodies of animals are usually present serve to attract members of the other sex during the breeding season. It is possible that the sails or the hump of the dinosaurs used for lovemaking, like Peacock tail. Stromer is theorized that males and females may have sails or bumps of various sizes. [1] It is possible that the sail or arms combined these functions; served as a regulator of heat, aids in courtship during the breeding season, and was used for cooling and, sometimes , was used for intimidation opponent when Spinosaurus was threatened.
 [Edit] Position of the body traditiconalno Although depicted as a biped, but since the seventies of the 20th century suggests that at least some time walking on all fours. [5] [28] This is supported by the discovery Baryonyxa, his relatives with robust arms. [29] The mass of bumps spunjene grease on the back of Spinosaurus (as proposed by Bailey 1997.) seems very possible that he was a quadruped, [10] which led to a new reconstruction of it as such. [29] The hypothesis that the Spinosaurus walked on four legs has recently fallen into disfavor, but could probably squat in the four-position . [30] [edit] Nutrition diagram of the skull. It is not known if Spinosaurus was mostly terrestrial predators or ribojed (as indicated by its elongated jaws, conical teeth, and set high nostrils). Hypothesis that they were specialized spinosauridi ribojedi as previously suggested, and AJ Charig A.
 C. Milner for Baryonyxa. These are suggested based on anatomical similarities with the presence of crocodiles and fish scales (which is stomach acid izjela) in the chest of a typical specimen Baryonyxa. [30] Big fish existed in the time existed spinosauridi, including Mawsoniau, which is mid-Cretaceous populated north Africa and Brazil. The only direct evidence of feeding spinosaurida comes from European and South American relatives. Baryonyx was found with fish scales and bones of a young Iguanodon in the stomach, also was found a tooth stuck in the bone of one South American pterosaurs, which indicates that they were often hunted. [31] Spinosaurus was probably a generalized and opportunistic predator, possibly Cretaceous equivalent grizzly; mostly fished, but it certainly was a vulture, and hunted small prey and the prey of medium size. [6] The reconstruction of the skull of S. aegyptiacus.
 Romain Amiot isotope analysis from 2010. years showed that ratio of oxygen isotopes in the teeth spinosaurida (including Spinosaurus teeth) indicates the amphibious way of life. [32] The ratio of isotopes in tooth enamel and other body parts Spinosaurus (which was found in Morocco and Tunisia) and other such spinosaurida Carcharodontosaurusa is then compared with the isotopic composition teropoda, turtles and crocodiles that lived at that time. [32] The investigation showed that the Spinosaurus teeth from five of the six sites had a ratio of oxygen isotopes closer to the turtles and crocodiles, as compared to other teeth teropoda from the same location. [32] The authors hypothesized that the Spinosaurus lived in water and on land and food competing with crocodiles and other large teropodima. [32] [edit] In popular culture, Spinosaurus had a prominent role in the film Jurassic Park 3 in 2001. year. [33] [34] He was portrayed as bigger and stronger than the tyrannosaur: in one scene that shows the struggle between these two predator, Spinosaurus emerges as the winner by a tyrannosaur bite his neck was broken. [35] In reality, the struggle is never could not happen, because they lived in different places on Earth (tyrannosaur in North America, Spinosaurus in North Africa) and in different periods (Tyrannosaurus lived during the late Cretaceous, a Spinosaurus in the early Cretaceous period).
 Spinosaurus was also shown in the video games and a figure related to Jurassic Park. Spinosaurus has long been displayed in popular books about dinosaurs, but only recently was enough information for its accurate representation. After an influential reconstruction of the skeleton which was published Lapparent and Lavocat, it appears mostly as bipedal teropod with skull skull similar to other teropoda, sail on his back, and even with four fingers on his hands. In addition to movies, figurines, video games and books, Spinosaurus is also displayed: [edit] Sources [edit] External links Wikimedia Commons has material on the topic: Spinosaurus Wikispecies has information on: Spinosaurus Retrieved from &quot;http://hr.wikipedia .org / wiki / Spinosaurus Categories: Extinct species | Geology | Paleontology | Dinosaurs
