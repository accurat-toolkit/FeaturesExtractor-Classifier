            <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/1577" title="View user profile.">Treg</a> on Fri, 10/01/2010 - 12:20<div class="taxonomy">in <ul class="links inline"><li class="taxonomy_term_854 first last"><a href="/forum/854" rel="tag" title="What grassroots strategies are you and your community taking to spread the message of liberty and freedom to the larger community?

</ul></div></span>    
    <div class="content"><p>In the history of Presidential Races, a few in my lifetime have had an Independent in the mix.  </p>
<p>The wonderful thing has been in the final months of the Presidential election, the Independent has been up there on the stage, debating one on two with the Democrat and the Republican. </p>
<p>When all eyes turn to the election in the final 3-4 months, having the national "choice" be between three candidates, the voting public reports time and again that they are happy to have 3 choices, rather than just 2.</p>
<p>With the voting public thoroughly dissatisfied with both Congress and the two major parties, more than any time in history, ... this just may be the year of the independent Presidential candidate.  More then ever, a 3 choice might just be the voting public's way of saying to the two parties, "we reject you both! You both have screwed up!"</p>
<p>John Anderson tried it.</p>
<p>Ross Perot tried it.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan tried it.</p>
<p>The question is... Will Ron Paul try it?</p>
<p>The GOP race is already set.  It will be Romney.</p>
<p>The only question is for Sarah Palin.  Does she want to run as VP again?  Certainly Mike Huckabee wants the offer, but he won't get it until Sarah makes up her mind.  And the GOP will not offer it to Sarah until she (and Glenn Beck) delivers the Tea Party to the GOP.  Fox news has done its bit by giving both Huckabee and Palin their own TV shows. (Ron got nothing--throw him to the Fox business financial news on very late night and very Earlie Morning news casts and let those RP crazy whore the video to their friends on the web).</p>
<p>That is the only inside game going on; who is the VP?. Romney is the GOP choice and will get all the money, time and support.  Michael Steele is under pressure from all sides because of this one single thing, he has not said privately that he backs Romney....so Steele may be gone and replaced with Newt/Huckabee/Palin, ie the one who fails to get the VP go-ahead.  </p>
<p>Bechtel Corporation, the owner of the Republican Party (recall folks the party is private organization and is owned by someone) has met extensively with Romney, and he is as on board with "the war on terror" more than Bush Jr ever was.  Huge Contracts for Bechtel and the rest? You betcha.  As for Jim DeMint, Ron Paul, Newt Grinrich, and all others, they are the side show colors that will be used USED by the media to make Romney appear as the "reasonable &amp; logical" choice. The recent Gallop poll of 908 republican voters and hundreds more like that will be used to TELL THE VOTERS who "their" choices are.  For you young guys/gals under 40, I know it my be hard for you to see, but this is how it is.</p>
<p>So come 2012 the American Choices will be:</p>
<p>#1) Democrat Party   -- Barack Obama/Biden<br />
#2) Republican Party -- Mitt Romney/Palin or Huckabee<br />
#3) Independent      -- Ron Paul/ Gary Johnson</p>
<p>In peace &amp; liberty,<br />

<p>PS... for those who still do not know that a TV Debate is about who answered the popular answer... watch; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RjeybojP9w" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RjeybojP9w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RjeybojP9w</a></p>
<p>On TV, its NOT a battle of Ideas..its a battle to get YOUR 20 second remarks in the news as many times as you can (that establishes 'legitimacy'.... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7QngRXPde4&amp;feature=related" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7QngRXPde4&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7QngRXPde4&amp;feature=related</a> </p>
<p>When Ross Perot made his message against Debt, Spending, and overseas military bases...America had just STARTED to listen... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hFG0dvYy3M" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hFG0dvYy3M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hFG0dvYy3M</a></p>
<p>But today in 2010 People are READY for this message.<br />
Today if they heard "giant sucking sound" they would NOT laugh...<br />

     <p>Third Party Rising<br />
By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN<br />
Published: October 2, 2010</p>
<p>"I continue to be astounded by the level of disgust with Washington, D.C., and our two-party system — so much so that I am ready to hazard a prediction: Barring a transformation of the Democratic and Republican Parties, there is going to be a serious third party candidate in 2012, with a serious political movement behind him or her — one definitely big enough to impact the election’s outcome."</p>
<p>"There is a revolution brewing in the country, and it is not just on the right wing but in the radical center. I know of at least two serious groups, one on the East Coast and one on the West Coast, developing “third parties” to challenge our stagnating two-party duopoly that has been presiding over our nation’s steady incremental decline." </p>
<p>Read all here: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/opinion/03friedman.html?_r=3" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/opinion/03friedman.html?_r=3">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/opinion/03friedman.html?_r=3</a></p>
<p>Again, even Thomas Friedman feels it coming, so where are YOU R3VOLution?????   Are you now sucking on the GOP tit?  That's so 2007.  </p>

<p>= The Independent Party just needs to Stand for only ONE THING: Giving Independents a paid for TELEVISED NATIONALIZED TV DEBATE PLATFORM.</p>
<p>Notice, we need not sell Ron Paul or anyone else, make a platform, or push any ideas.  </p>
<p>The VOTERS are THERE.  </p>
<p>Moreover, THE MONEY IS THERE.</p>
<p>The question for YOU is, where do you want to take this R3VOLUtion?</p>

     <p>since Abraham Lincoln. We sometimes forget, the Republican Party, at its inception, was a third party.<br />
It became, in a couple of years, the dominent party, as the Whig Party disintegrated and the Democratic Party split over slavery.</p>
<p>Glad to read one of your responders is from Arizona; because, I believe, you have the most pivotal Senate race in the country.  So far, I've created five video ads for David Nolan (LP) and, were  we to stage one money bomb for (to pay for commercial broadcast of the ads), I'm certaiin Dave would have a very good chance of beating John McCain.</p>

     <p>"1/3 of registered Arizona voters are Independent voters"</p>
<p>Wow! Time to make the "Independent Party" an official Party name I think.</p>
<p>Time to start funding it and they will come because they are already THERE. </p>
<p>Time to spell out the 10 planks.</p>
<p>Time to Raise the money and Buy the TV DEBATE TIME for your candidates.</p>
<p>As the economy hits crises so will the two party crisis hit.  It seems to me the "voters" have a Party without an organization.</p>
<p>I can hear the door knocking campaign now....</p>
<p>YOU: "Knock, Knock"</p>
<p>"Hello?"</p>
<p>YOU: "Hi, is this Mrs. Johnson? (Mrs Very Frustrated?)" </p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Yes, what is this about?"</p>
<p>YOU: "Our records show that you are not registered as Democrat or a Republican, is that right?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Oh yes, we registered as Independents".  </p>
<p>YOU: "Great. I am glad we've found you. Do you know we now are holding our own Televised Debates for our own Independent Candidates?" </p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Really? Well its about time. I am tired of watching just two people on stage come election time". </p>
<p>YOU: "We could not agree more.  We now have our own party, the Independent Party.  We are of course neither democrats or republicans, neither left or right.  Would you like to give $10 to join the Independent Party?  By joining you can support Independent candidates who sing a different tune and have different answers to today's problems."  </p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Well what does the Independent Party stand for?"</p>
<p>YOU: "The Independent Party allows you to vote the person."</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Well what is the platform? What does the Independent Party stand for?"</p>
<p>YOU: "There is no platform. As you know, those who run as an independent have their own mind. Its our job to hear them out. Of course the person running as an Independent may be more conservative on one or two issues, while liberal something else, green on another issues, and even constitutionalists or libertarian on other issues. Again, there is no platform, we vote the person.  The points is, you get to vote the person and what they stand for."</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Do you think a 3rd party has a chance against the democrats or republicans? You know Ross Perot tried it and only got I think 17% of the vote." </p>
<p>YOU:  "Yes I do. Back in Ross Perot's day not many people thought of themselves as Independents. Do you know that 1/3 of Arizona's voters today are registered as Independents?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Wow, is that true?" </p>
<p>YOU: "Yes, take a look at this data straight from the voter registration rolls. You will see that democrats are just above 1/3 and republicans are about a 1/3. SO we Independents, we are a force today and we don't even know it!"  </p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Wow! Its good to know I am not the only one. I know some friends of mine that vote democrat or republican, but they are frustrated too."</p>
<p>YOU:  "With your $10 donation to our private Independent Party, it will go to a National Television debate full -let me repeat that -FULL of Independent Candidates!!!!!".  </p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Wow, Ok, here's my ten dollars."</p>
<p>YOU: "I am sorry I cannot accept any money. I am just a volunteer and we don't take money. Because we are very open with our books, its all automated. We ask that you go online here at <a href="http://www.iparty.org" title="www.iparty.org">www.iparty.org</a> and make your donation."</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated:  "Oh that is safe I guess".</p>
<p>YOU:  "Yes it is. You can see the thermometer grow as donation poor in. And you can watch how and where your money gets spent."</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "What is the Independent Party spending its money on?"</p>
<p>YOU:  "That is a good question. You can see that all on line. Best of all, all members can view the expenses and the income. Its all open book in real time." </p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "What will I see when I get into the website?"</p>
<p>YOU:  "You will see that there is just two expense categories that you can contribute too. One is for the TELEVISED NATIONAL DEBATES by the Independent Party to be aired 4 months before elections"</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "and the other is..?"</p>
<p>YOU: "and the other category is the Independent Candidate's campaign itself. You can pick one or both to contribute money.  We try to keep it real simple."</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "But is it safe or will I be reading in the paper how someone ran off with the money?</p>
<p>YOU:  "Good question. Its all on-line, open book, open software, and open to anyone who wishes to audit us."</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Who gets paid in running the day to day operations of the Independent Party?"</p>
<p>YOU:  "Wow! another good question. The 5 board members who do take a salary also have their accounts all on-line and you can track their whereabouts and spending. We believe that is how government ought to be, OPEN for us to see, while we citizens stay private".</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Ok, it sounds interesting. One thing for sure is I know my husband and I do not want to be stuck with two lousy choices yet again. It seems as far back as 1971 all we get is two lousy choices. I would rather vote for the local university president to be president than some of the people that we have had. I would join today but my computer is giving me problems."</p>
<p>YOU:  "Oh that is not a problem. We have a laptop and a secure line. Would you like to do it right here?"  </p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Yes. And I will contribute $100 not ten because really want to see the TV Debates, then choose my candidate after that."</p>
<p>YOU:  "Is there anything else I can do for you?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "I don't know, do we have a logo? You know the Democrats are donkeys and the Republicans are Elephants...."</p>
<p>YOU:  "I think many of us are copying and using this Wise Old Owl who stands on the tree of liberty, holds the Constitution in one hand and the Liberty torch in the other while draped in the American Flag. Would you like to see it? Its kind of cute. Sure beats that fat elephant and dumb donkey!  Go here and copy it if you like. The owner wants us to copying it and use as we wish.  <a href="http://politicalzoocartoon.com/" title="http://politicalzoocartoon.com/">http://politicalzoocartoon.com/</a>  "</p>
<p>Mrs. Very Frustrated: "Wow! Thank You! I can't wait to break the two party system.  Its like Coke &amp; Pepsi, and its now time for some Tea!"</p>

<p>Someone like Ron Paul could then "Run as an INDEPENDENT" knowing that the Nationalized TV Debates will be aired on prime-time - in competition to the two other parties little party.   </p>

     <p>HART/McINTURFF Study #101061--page 1<br />
September 2010 NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey<br />
Interviews: 1000 adults, including 200 reached by cell phone</p>
<p>The poll does NOT ask about RON PAUL.  However, If anything is to be gleaned from the poll, it is that the ELECTORATE is for the 1st time VERY OPEN to a 3rd party Independent Run.   NEVER has a 3rd Party been more appealing to the electorate.  Polls like this have found since the days of John Anderson's run, Ross Perot's run, and Pat Buchanan's run, that a 3rd party run only appealed to 8-9% of the electorate.  Most felt it "hurt the two party system".  Well today, most would like to do exactly that, "hurt the two party system".  The mood is now at 25% are supportive of ANY 3rd Party Independent Run! </p>
<p>Relevant Poll question: </p>
<p>"If the choice in your district had the following, would you be more likely to vote for a -- (ROTATE:)<br />
Republican candidate for Congress, a Democratic candidate for Congress -- or an independent or third party candidate for Congress?</p>
<p>Republican candidate .............. 31 32 31<br />
Democratic candidate ...............36 34 34<br />
Independent/3rd party candidate.... 25 25 25<br />
Not sure  ............................. 8 9 10</p>

<p>The question for you and me in the R3VOLution is this... "Will We Pre- $$$ money Bomb an INDEPENDENT PARTY Platform, and get Politicians begging to champion it?"  Where do we want to be most effective in putting in our precious energies and money?  Inside the GOP, most of which are still drinking the pro-war koolaid?  Well, we have a 25% head start for the very first time in America with an Independent run.  </p>

     <p>statistics.</p>
<p>Notice you are referencing a poll relevant ONLY to congressional elections, NOT the presidency.</p>
<p>Also, getting a general sentiment says nothing.  Because when ACTUAL candidates have filed and qualified and are on the ballot, and the media campaigns start, all of a sudden that 25% drops to nill.</p>
<p>Case in point - I'm talking politics with the family last night.  They want to know why the LP doesn't have a candidate for a certain statewide office today.  (we are having an election today for various state and local offices)  My reply, is that we don't have anyone with enough money to break the media barrier.</p>
<p>They reply that we don't have the money, because we don't have a candidate with charisma, that's why people don't donate to the LP.</p>
<p>My reply is that sorry, the money HAS to come first.  No one will even notice an unknown candidate with charisma if he doesn't have the money to be taken more than seriously by the media, or to buy his way around them.</p>
<p>They tried to use Perot as an example of talking directly to the people, with charisma as to why he got as far as he did.</p>
<p>I reminded them, Perot was a billionaire that spent a small fortune buying air-time before the MSM knew what hit them.  But that can only be tried once.  After that, they are on to you, and they will do whatever they can to lock you out.</p>
<p>The sad truth is, in most cases, there are no 3rd party candidates rich enough and connected enough to be taken seriously enough to have a shot at the voters even knowing they exist.  And any that are rich or connected enough, would be untrustworthy to hold office.</p>
<p>Voters are generally lazy.  They won't seek out 3rd party candidates, and are waiting for the perfect one to plop in their lap.  I would like to see a followup statistic on those who answered 3rd party as to how they voted in their Congressional races this year both if, and if they did not have options other than Ds or Rs.  My bet, is the 3rd party candidates might get a combined 1-5% tops.</p>

     <p>Yes, put a Check in that box... Yes, Private money comes first into the private Party.  Then comes the Politician, then comes the TV to suck up those advertising monies.  </p>
<p>Check, there are currently two privately funded private parties, the democrat and the republican parties.</p>
<p>Check, these two are CENTRALLY FUNDED from the top down FIRST, then donations come in from the 10% paying hard core koolaid drinkers inside that party, and the other 20% freeloads and votes reliably. </p>
<p>Check, there is NOTHING stopping us from funding our Independent Party in a DECENTRALIZED fashion, from the Bottom up.  ($100 Money Bombs are very powerful tools we have). </p>
<p>Check, once a $20,000,000 INDEPENDENT PARTY is funded, just like the above, candidates appear, then comes TV.</p>
<p>Check, Ballot access is the last of our concerns. Its been done before by the libertarians, the Greens, and Ross Perot.  It can be done.  But we do not want it done too soon.  For that is where all sorts of "laws" come into play.  </p>
<p>Check, if ballot access is the last of our concerns right now, what is the first concern?  STRUCTURE.  Getting our DECENTRALIZED STRUCTURE DOWN and IN PLACE.  For there lies our power and our strength and will also make us hard to deal with.  The things we did FOR the Ron Paul Campaign could not have been done INSIDE the Ron Paul Campaign. Indeed, the campaign was STRONG because of our decentralized nature.  Harnessing that Decentralized nature to RAISE FUNDs for an INDEPENDENT PARTY, unregistered at that, makes us a "wild card".  An "unregulated outside the boundaries" wild card.  I like that.  So, getting our decentralized money raising and handling structure down, is JOB ONE. </p>
<p>Can it be done?  You tell me.  The question is, is the R3VOLution going to play along INSIDE the 2-party "system" and get burned again?  Or is it going to take its own fate into its own hands and produce its OWN MONEY and MAKE ITS OWN TELEVISED PRIME-TIME DEBATES?  </p>
<p>You tell me what inspires you and I will tell you what will work.</p>

     <p>You can write them in, but they will not be counted.  You have to be officially recognized by the state as a write-in candidate.  I actually heard this from the guy who runs the Libertarian Party, and I know that it is true here in California (<a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/cand_qual_wi.pdf">qualifications of write-in candidates</a> [pdf]).

     <p>juncture 4 years ago.</p>
<p>Look how that turned out for him.</p>
<p>Your prognostications are premature.</p>
<p>Also, you are not taking into account some very fundamental changes that have happened since Perot ran.  (Buchannan was NOT in the debates)</p>
<p>#1 and the most important - The League of Women Voters is no longer incharge of the Presidential Debates.  This is now 100% in the hands of the BI-PARTISON (meaning ONLY 2) debate commission.  They took it over before '96.  Perot only got in because he was in the last time in '92.  They couldn't tell him no and not experience a huge backlash.</p>
<p>But they have since raised the bar.  You have to be polling 15% in the polls they say you have to be in.  But if the pollsters never include you in the list of choices, you can't very well poll at all now can you?</p>
<p>So the game is rigged - no independents or 3rd parties will be allowed in the debates again.  They will do everything they can to prevent polling of anyone else, and if anyone does sneak in, they will do what they can to see to it, those numbers are sabotaged, or outright faked.</p>
<p>#2 - McLame-Feingold: the laws on raising money for such campaigns are so screwed up now, it is a nightmare.  They've made it very easy for very rich and connected people to funnel vast sums to the 'preffered' candidates and parties, but anyone else is SOL.</p>
<p>There is only one way to win the presidency now:</p>
<p>go through either the Dem or Rep parties.</p>
<p>The only way around this is open armed revolution and just killing every criminal in government.  But of course, we don't want to see that happen because of the chaos it would bring.  So we are left with trying to outfox the foxes and beat them within their own system.</p>
<p>Finally, let me add one more hurdle - getting on the ballot in not only enough states, but all 50 takes tremendous resources that only a billionaire truly has.  And Ron Paul is no billionaire.  And that's just to get on the ballot.  I didn't even scratch the surface of actually winning enough states to get to 270 votes.</p>

	<h3 class="title"><a href="/node/145759#comment-1548964" class="active">samadamscw, those are 3 very good points. Lets review:</a></h3>
    <div class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/1577" title="View user profile.">Treg</a> on Sat, 10/02/2010 - 19:46.</div>
    <div class="content">
     <p>Point one:  Who Controls the Debates?  You are correct, give that many a star.  The owners of the private political parties control who gets in. Just ask Ralf Nader.  So agree with your fact. It is true, very true.</p>
<p>Point two:  Laws raising money (and advertizing and running campaigns) are a spegetti mess.  So very true on point two. </p>
<p>Point three:  Getting on the ballot in 50 States.  Not easily done, no sirree.  </p>
<p>++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Now lets examine these points, one by one.</p>
<p>They control the two parties and have tight controls over the nationally televised debates.  They control (somewhat) the national media, since the media runs to where the advertising dollars are and to where the eye balls are....(that is why TV never has anything good to say about the internet, they hate the eyeball competition.  </p>
<p>While the two parties are private, our 3rd party can be private also, with all the advantages that come with it.  Stop and let that sink in for a while. It is not as if we are trying to start a new NFL team and want to play INSIDE the NFL.  It is not as if we are starting a new NBA basketball team that must play INSIDE the NBA. We can start our private 3rd Party, indeed we could call it the 3rd Party.  </p>
<p>Next, raising money for the 3rd Party.  Its easy, the R3VOLUtion proved that.  Moreover, the R3VOLution, being OUTSIDE of the RON PAUL CAMPAIGN, was FREE to do a million things that a "legal" campaign could not.  Stop and reflect on the power of that for a day or two. We can run a campaign, run a party, OUTSIDE the legal world of the "two party system".  The libertarian party plays inside the legal game, we can play outside the game as free unassociated autonomous individuals.  The Internet is our world.  </p>
<p>Next we can FUND our own TV ads, fund our own shows, and most of all, FUND OUR OWN TELEVISED DEBATES. The means raising the Money to Fund our own is key.  Funding Our Independent TV debates, could be made top notch with all the TV graphics and set design. We could strategically and collectively decide the times of broadcasts.  Our talent in this area is amazingly deep.  We would field many interesting..INTERESTING INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES...perhaps they could be Jesse Ventura, Ron Paul, Gary Johnson, Chuck Baldwin, Jake Towne, Ralph Nader, John Denis, Cynthia McKinnon, Charles Goyette, Mary Ruwart and ???? many others...... and BIG TV Ratings.  TV ratings could be very high, considering how BORING Romney &amp; Obama race will be. And, smart placement of the "INDEPENDENT DEBATES" will get hold over views or pre-viewers who just can't help themselves.  "There is a new game in town, and its not Obama and its not Romney, these Independents have something to say. Should we be listening?"-asks a news commentator.  "They raised well over 20 million in just 48 hours and they produced their own prime time televised debates. Should they be taken seriously?  Are you taking them seriously? Can they win? For that we now ask our team of panelists".   (status quo spinners).  If a network or interviewer is particularly evil to us, we buy time on another Cable Channel, network, and so forth.  To do this, we must design our system of control to be DECENTRALIZED. I was very impressed how many in the R3VOLution got this by making a dozen commercial ads, then letting those who gave $20 the right to vote on the final one to be aired.  Such structure will be the key to our power and success.  It will also be the key to the Elites downfall, for they will not know how to battle 1 million decentralized but well organized activist revolutionaries.  In 2007, we owned the Internet, now in 2010 we can own TV.  The CHOICE is yours, if you BELIEVE.    What the mind can conceive, the body can achieve.   </p>
<p>Meanwhile we will be doing the ONLY THING interesting in the USA.  We in the R3VOLution could slice and mix and make great 30 second videos from our "INDEPENDENT DEBATES" broadcasts. A winner could emerge from all this TV exposure, funded and paid for by US, that the natural step would be for that person to be measured against the Obama vs Romney "choice".     </p>
<p>Getting on the ballot in all 50 states.  Perot asked his volunteers to do it, they did it.  It can be done.  The libertarians Party is on in just about 50 states, so is the Green Party and the Constitution party.  Point is, it can be done and has been done. The question is not your 3 very good ones...</p>
<p>The question is, how much are we going to play their game?  How much are we going to submit...to the two private parties?  </p>
<p>On the front page of DP is a TED lecture about the power of decentralization.  We feel powerless, but we are not.  We saw what Meet Up dot com can do.  We saw the power of the $100 money bomb.  We can raise $20,000,000 in 48 hours.  That is power.  How to harness our decentralized power and direct it onto building a national TV platform for an Independent Run, is the only real question.  It We can BUY our way onto NETWORK TV and GET NETWORK TV time.  We can make ourselves a legitimate player.  25% of the voting electric WANT to see something like that HAPPEN.  The question is, how.  </p>
<p>Its much like the problem an entrepreneur has whose surveys of the soda drinking &amp; consuming public tells him that the public WANTS something different, but what?  Coke &amp; Pepsi rule the day. They have an Oligarchical power over the pop distribution market.  When something does come on the seen, they borg it into their product line.  Unlike Coke and Pepsi, who can borg  Rock Star and Monster real fast... the DEMs and the REPs cannot borg that fast.  There is one if not 2 whole election cycles that will be needed to do that.  That means, we have a real shot at getting into the White House &amp; into Congress &amp; Senate someone, really unique.  </p>
<p>We just need to CREATE the PRIVATE PARTY SPACE, FUND THE SPACE PRIVATELY, and let it EVOLVE into something politically new.  </p>
<p>As it stands now, we have nothing to Win inside the GOP or DNC.  Those 30% koolaid drinkers are not sway-able.  But 12% off the top have defected, calling themselves neither liberals or conservatives, but INDEPENDENTS.   They THEY have chosen their new brand.  The question is, who wants to be the Brand? Who wants to carry the Independent Banner?  Who IS "Mr. Independent?"  </p>
<p>Well for that, lets be a PRIVATE PARTY (like they are).  Lets make it our own exclusive club (Dems &amp; Reps are not allowed in).  Most of all, lets tap into our massive decentralized power (theirs we know is centralized at the Elite top).  Lets be nimble, tap into our own collective intelligence, our own CROWD WISDOM.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-Collective-Economies-Societies/dp/B002VM0L3Q/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1286061667&amp;sr=8-3" title="http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-Collective-Economies-Societies/dp/B002VM0L3Q/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1286061667&amp;sr=8-3">http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-Collective-Economies-Soc...</a></p>

     <p>Only if you want a Democrat in the White House for 4 more years.</p>
<p>If Ron Paul can't win the nomination in the Republican Party, he will not come out on top of a three way race, and will end up splitting the Republican vote.</p>
<p>Ron Paul should run, but in the Republican primary.  The ruling class old guard are fighting to keep their hold on the Party, but they are losing ground each year. Ron has a better chance to win the Republican Primary than he does of winning in a three way race in the general election.  In addition, the Republican nomination will add momentum he will never have as an independent candidate.  I doubt that he would even be included in any debates as an independent.</p>
<p>And you purists who diss Ron Paul and his son should think again of the alternatives.  Ask yourselves why the neocon Republican establishment hates them so much.</p>

     <p>I personaly do not care whether a republican or democrat is elected if Ron Paul is not elected. Whats the difference? I do agree however, his best chance is thru the republican primary as thing stand right now. But we should remember 2012 is a long way away and things are developing very rapidly. By 2012 I think the American people will be ready to elect Dr Paul no matter how he runs.</p>

<p>The one thing that makes it seem nearly impossible to elect a good candidate to the presidency is the fact that voters elected Obama.</p>

     <p>That would be very difficult and require a pre-arranged coalition.</p>
<p>Why would he do that after he already cow-towed to the Republicans by campaigning for the establishment and did not endorse Medina because of the incumbency of Perry?</p>
<p>He has established himself as a Republican.</p>
<p>He would be attacked, rightly so, if he were to run as an independent.</p>
<p>Here is what is going to happen ...</p>
<p>Either Obama will be re-elected or Ron Paul will be elected.</p>
<p>I see no other alternative at this point.</p>
<p>The only reason why he would run as an independent, and, consequently, insure an Obama "MANDATE" is because all the following will be satisfied:</p>
<p>1.  He will retire prior to 2012.<br />
2.  He is confident that his ideas have taken root.<br />
3.  Rand will be the new Senior Senator from KY due to the announcement that McConnell will be retiring.<br />
4.  All third parties, on both sides, have elected not to run a candidate and endorse Ron Paul.</p>
<p>Short of that, he will not run as an independent.</p>

     <p>Big difference.  </p>
<p>Moreover, 2010 public is very angry with spending and big government.  The public in 1988 was all dreaming with the small government RHETORIC of Ronald Reagan-- they thought he was the real deal.  Why listen to the Libertarian Ron Paul when we have Ronald Reagan?  They didn't listen.</p>
<p>There is no Ronald Reagan today.  Mittens can pretend all he wishes, but he's no Ronald Reagan.</p>

     <p>Actually, there are lots of Reagans today - socialists masquerading as conservatives. Palin's a phony, Romney's a phony, etc. Reagan was a Red, and until you figure that out, you are living in a fantasy land.</p>
<p>There are few bigger fans of Ron Paul than me, and I will work for him again if he runs. But capturing the Presidency is not the answer. The problem is not going to be fixed from the top down - iow, the Federal level. That is why I have such high hopes for the 10th Amendment movement and nullification.</p>
<p>Obviously, we can be working on both at the same time, and should. And if Dr. Paul is elected President, it will be a lot easier than if he isn't, but he alone cannot fix the problem.</p>
