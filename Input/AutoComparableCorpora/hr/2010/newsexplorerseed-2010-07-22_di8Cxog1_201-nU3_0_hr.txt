"He jumped the gun, partly because we now live in this media culture where something goes up on YouTube or a blog and everybody scrambles," the president told "Good Morning America." Obama, who called Sherrod to apologize for the White House's overreaction, said he hopes members of his administration can learn from the headline-grabbing controversy of the past few days. "I've told my team and I told my agencies that we have to make sure that we're focusing on doing the right thing instead of what looks to be politically necessary at that very moment. We have to take our time and, and think these issues through," the president told ABC. "If there's a lesson to be drawn from this episode, it's that rather than us jumping to conclusions and pointing fingers at each other, we should all look inward and try to examine what's in our own hearts and, as a consequence, I think we will continue to make progress," he said. Vilsack also personally apologized to Sherrod and offered her a better job at the Agriculture Department, but she said Thursday she hasn't decided whether to accept. Watch the ABC interview:
