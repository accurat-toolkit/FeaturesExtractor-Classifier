24SI - Heat from the Gulf of Mexico has now raised protuerupcijski valve springs Macondo, a key piece of equipment that 20th April has not done his job and closed source, thus began the worst oil spills in peacetime history. Announcing the 20 meters long and 300 tons of heavy valve bottoms lasted 29.5, and began a little longer after he was replaced on the bottom. Five floors long the device could not be removed immediately, because it created the crystals of methane, which could potentially ignite. On board Helix Q4000, in which the valve is located, there were 137 people, including FBI agents and investigators of various agencies. Protuerupcijski valve could be a key forensic evidence that will show why there was a whole disaster. It is a device that would, if an explosion should close the source, as this valve is not done. Investigators know that the explosion caused a bubble of methane gas escaped from the source and climbed up through the drill pipe, but I do not know exactly how the gas escaped.
 Also do not know why the valve is not activated after the explosion. Previous hearings have not provided a clear picture of it. Steve Newman, president of the company Transocean, which owns a platform which is operated by British Petroleum, said during the hearing that there is no evidence that the device is not ready and he stated that the cause may have been the accumulation of waste after the blast. After the explosion that killed 11 workers, started the whole disaster. Deepwater Horizon has sunk two days later, in the next four months in the Gulf leaked nearly a million gallons of oil.
