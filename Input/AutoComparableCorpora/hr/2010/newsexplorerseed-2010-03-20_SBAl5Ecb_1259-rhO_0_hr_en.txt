Thousands of Russians demonstrated in many Russian cities demanding resignation of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The demonstrators were unhappy with the economic policies and the level of political freedom. Police banned demonstrations in Moscow, and many activists were arrested. The opposition has called for citizens&#39; day of wrath and anger. &quot; The number of protesters is not large, such as Vladivostok them gathered around 1500, but given that this is a country in which the secret service kill journalists who takes a critical approach towards those in power can say that this is a very brave act. Given the difficult situation in Croatia, and certainly more difficult than in Russia, the question is why do not demonstrate the Croats? On the contrary, Croats applaud and give support to politicians who have caused this sickly state of the Croatian society (for example, we had the visit of Prime Minister Kosor shipyard when her employees after its empty promises applauded stripped and shook hands with her).
 Is it a sign of pure desperation (and a glimmer of hope seen in his executioner) or the authoritarianism of the ruling (one of the characteristics of authoritarian regimes is to support people and politicians that they are working on the head)? Or is Kosor, just more dangerous than Putin himself.
