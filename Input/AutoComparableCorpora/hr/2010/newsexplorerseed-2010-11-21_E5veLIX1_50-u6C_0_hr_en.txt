U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday announced the ratification of the US-Russian agreement on reducing nuclear weapons, known as a new start, &quot;the imperative of national security,&quot; saying that the Senate must act at the last session in the old session, before the interruption of work for the Christmas holidays. Barack Obama (Photo: Reuters) Obama has expressed confidence that the Senate will be enough votes for ratification of the START agreement, noting that every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan won support for such agreements. Senate needs a two-thirds majority of 67 votes for the ratification of the New START, which seemed quite certain until Wednesday when Jon kyl senator from Arizona, the chief Republican negotiator in the Senate, withdrew his consent to ratify the agreement at the last meeting this year. Linking ratification of START and the allocation of additional funds for the military-industrial complex, intended to modernize U.S. nuclear arsenal, Kyle was asked to be a serious debate on the ratification of the agreement and leave the new session of the Senate.
 Democrats in the current session with 59 of 100 seats in the new session will have six seats or less, and next year will be harder to secure a majority for ratification. Giving a statement from the White House, Obama is surrounded by former secretary of state and defense ministers from both parties, who all support START and the leaders of his own administration. White House meeting on Thursday called former secretaries of state Madeleine Albright, James Baker and Henry Kissinger, former Minister of Defence William Cohen and William Perry and former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, to demonstrate that the ratification of START-New and national interest and that there is no room party contest. Obama said that you now &#39;can not afford to gamble&#39; with the ability to check Russia&#39;s strategic nuclear arsenal, which is a central element of the agreement. He also warned that the U.S. can not risikirati loss of Moscow&#39;s support in other matters of national security, including the pressure on Iran over its alleged efforts to produce nuclear weapons.
 &#39;It is not about politics. It is about national security. It&#39;s not a question that can be postponed, &quot;warned a statement from Obama in the White House Roosevelt Room. When asked by reporters whether there are enough votes in the Senate, Obama said: &quot;I am convinced that we should be able to get the votes&#39;. Agreement to the nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia by 1550 to reduce strategic nuclear warheads from the current 2200, and established new procedures for mutual inspections arsenal. Obama&#39;s administration has pledged to invest $ 80 billion in medernizaciju nuclear arsenal in the next 10 years, and last Friday offered an additional 4.1 billion U.S. dollars over the next five years, to get the Senator Kyle and votes Republican for ratification.
