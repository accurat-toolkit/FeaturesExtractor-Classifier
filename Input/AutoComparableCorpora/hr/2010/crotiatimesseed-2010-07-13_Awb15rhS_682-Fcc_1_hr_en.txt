Number 551 Tags: EU, Eurostat Release Date: 09.07.2010. Author: Nicholas Bajto Eurostat monitors and compares statistics for all 27 member states, where the good part of the report include the candidate countries, Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey. While Croatia will accede to the Union at least five years after Bulgaria and Romania, and seven years of great expansion in which he received ten countries, development trends show that in a number of aspects exceed the part of countries in the group, provided that it successfully out of the current crisis. There are a number of statistical indicators by which Croatia at the bottom of the European scale, but in the woods Eurostat data found only one, albeit not particularly significant, in which the worst in Europe, and there is even one positive indicator by which stand in relation to all other countries. Employment We are not lazy, but we are at the bottom of the employment rate RH has the same productivity as well as Slovenia and Slovakia, and better than Romanian, Portuguese, Polish, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and even the Czech Croatian worker productivity since 2000.
 until the crisis has grown from 61.4 percent to 77.9 percent of the EU average, making it at par with the Slovak and Slovene worker. The highest productivity in Luxembourg (168.2) and lowest in Bulgaria (37.2), and the RH is better than another Romanian, Portuguese, Polish, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and even the Czech Republic, so it follows that Croatian workers are not lazy as much as they are displayed as such. From the Eurostat data can be seen that the problem actually is that slackers make up almost half the active population aged 15-64 years. Specifically, the employment rate in Croatia was only 56.6 percent, which is the Hungarian Maltese 54.9 and 55.4 percent of the worst in Europe. Union average was 64.6 percent in the Netherlands 77 percent, which is difficult to exceed with respect to that portion of the educated population, and unemployment in the country amounts to only 3.4 percent. Therefore, unemployment in Croatia is 9.1 percent, which the EU is closer to 8.9 percent in the crisis 2009th
 year, comparatively not as problematic as the problematic high proportion of early retirees and eligible in the age of the working age population. With the Netherlands, the lowest unemployment rate recorded last year, Austria (4.8) percent, and Spain the highest (18) and Latvia (17.1) percent. Due to the loss of male jobs in 2009. reversal occurred, and the female unemployment (8.8 percent) in the EU was even lower than male unemployment (9 percent), while the RH 8 percent of unemployed men and women 10.3 percent. There we have inequality deepening of social differences, Croatia enters into a society which is gradually growing inequality in income distribution, and currently the richest 20 percent have five times more income than the poorest 20 percent of GDP by purchasing power parity in the RC at 63 percent of the EU average, and by its purchasing power, which amounts to 15 700 euros per year, the citizens of Croatia even before the seven current members of the EU and Bulgaria and Romania are on the bottom with 10 400 euros, and Latvia, Lithuanian, Polish, Hungarian and Estonian.
 However, the average purchasing power of the EU population is 23 600 euros, while even 63 200 in Luxembourg and more than 30,000 in Ireland and the Netherlands. Consuption of Croatian households spending at a level of 76 percent of the EU average, with 145 percent of Danish and Bulgarian at the top 53 percent at the bottom. Food prices in Croatia on 93 percent of the EU average, Denmark&#39;s most expensive with 132 percent, and the cheapest Poland with 63 percent, with the Eurostat data show that prices within the EU are increasingly approaching. Entering the EU, Croatia enters into a society in which gradually increasing inequality in income distribution, and currently the richest 20 percent have five times more income than the poorest 20 percent. Of course, that no transitional RH is a shining example, though with a gap of 4.5 times is still below the EU average. In the UK, which is otherwise the notion of stratification, these revenues were 5.6 times higher, but the inequalities leading Latvia (7.3), Romania (7) and Bulgaria (6.5), and the smallest gap in Slovenia, Slovakia , Czech Republic and Sweden (3.4).
 The share of people below the national poverty threshold in the EU is 17 percent and 18 percent RH, while the risk of poverty for at least threaten the Czechs (9) and Dutch (11), most Latvians (26) and Romanians (23 percent). Education We have completed several high school students from Germany, however, the number of students, Croatia is below the EU average, where 3.8 percent of the total student population, whereas in our study 3.2 percent of the population in Croatia were 95.4 percent of youths aged between 20 . and 24 There behind a high school education, which is considerably more than in, for example, France (83.4 percent) or Germany (74.1 percent) and some other developed countries. The European average is 78.5 percent, but above all the former socialist countries, where Croatia 2003. was then overtaken by the leading Slovak and Czech. They now have 92.3 percent and 91.6 percent of youth who have completed secondary school, and at the bottom of the Malta with 53 percent and Portugal with 54.3 percent.
 On the other hand, from which one can not conclude anything about the quality of secondary education, that is, for example in learning foreign languages, fol. In the Croatian schools teach an average of 1.2 foreign languages per pupil, while the EU average of 1.5, while leading the Luxembourgers with 2.5 and Finnish languages and Maltese language with a 2.2, while the British and Irish who do not have to learn English at the bottom of the Hungarians and Poles with one language per student. Croatia with 98.3 percent of students who are learning English at the European top, highly above average in Germany, and at the very bottom of the French language, taught by 22 percent European and only 3.4 percent of Croatian students. According to the number of students, however, Croatia is below the EU average, where 3.8 percent of the total student population, a Croatian 140 000 students makes 3.2 percent of its population. This is comparable with the Czech 3.2 percent, and almost half of the Finnish 5.9 or 5.8 percent Slovene.
 Croatia is also, along with Cyprus and Hungary, at the tail of the European scale by the number of students in science and technology, with a share of less than twice the EU average. But the share of female students from 54.1 percent similar to Europe of 55.2 percent, while their share in scientific, mathematical, computer, engineering and construction, and is still predominantly &quot;male&quot; professions, higher than the European average. The mobility of Croatian students, with 9200 of them to study abroad, even twice the EU average, but in the opposite direction, with only 200 Europeans to study in Croatia is negligible compared to the nearly 550,000 foreign students in other countries. Public investment in education in the EU at the level of five per cent of GDP, which leads to Denmark with 7.83 percent, while Croatia, with its 4.07 percent from the fourth floor. Private sector investment in the EU is 0.73 percent of GDP in Croatia, only 0.35 percent.
 Total is a European average of investment in education 6285.5 euros per students per year, while Croatia, with its 3741.9 euros in the third place from the bottom of the ladder. Also, Croatia is lagging behind in preschool education, which includes even 88.6 percent of Europe&#39;s four-year (in France, Italy and Belgium, 100 percent), while the RH from 50 percent at the bottom again, after the Polish and Irish who have more than 44 percent. The expected duration of education throughout life is increasing all over Europe for 2007. amounts to 17.2 years, with the longest in Finland (20.5) and Sweden (19.7), while the RH is 15.2 years. All in all, it is clear that Croatia is lagging behind in higher education, both at the level of investments and the involvement of the population. It is unclear how the state, which hold back the free study, to state of mind improve. Population assemble an above-average number of marriages, Croatia belongs to countries with a more conservative attitude toward marriage, so it made a 5.27 marriages per year per thousand inhabitants, while the EU average and 4.87 after the accession of Croatia will have less than one percent of the population Union, with its 78.5 inhabitants per square kilometer, will fall in the less populated states, far below the Dutch or Belgian 485.3 350 inhabitants.
 As the 28th States, will fall in nine EU countries which, because of migration and insufficient growth to lose population, where, except in the German case, a row is a new member. For now, the trend of population loss have managed to reverse only the Czech 2003rd Poland and the 2008th year. According to Eurostat statistics on population, Croatia belongs to countries with a more conservative attitude toward marriage, so it made a 5.27 marriages per year per thousand inhabitants, while the EU average 4.87. Most weddings in Cyprus (7.71) and Lithuania (7.17) and lowest in Slovenia (3.32) and Bulgaria (3.64). Although the number of divorces in the older states in recent years, stable, increasing in countries of the newly arrived, while the EU average and 2.1 per thousand population distribution, then come to a divorce 2.3 marriages. At least a divorce in Catholic Ireland (0.8) and Italy (0.9), immediately followed by Croatia and Slovenia (1.1), while such conservative Poland has 1.7 divorces per thousand population.
 Most divorces in Belgium (3.3), Lithuania (3.1) and the Czech Republic (3). The same rate of divorce in Croatia and Slovenia is only apparent, because in Croatia, a divorce comes to 4.8 marriages, and in Slovenia in three marriages. Figure conservative Croatian family reinforces the fact that only 12.02 percent of children born outside marriage, by which Croatia is third, behind Greece (5.93 percent) and Cyprus (8.88 percent), while the EU average and slightly above 30 percent in Estonia, France and Belgium more than 50 percent. Health They are killing us alcohol and turnover rate of 5.1, Croatia at the acclaimed third place in the mortality from alcohol, behind Denmark (12.6) and Estonia (10.9) No matter what kind of community is born, a male child in Croatia can expect to live 72.43 years, while the EU average 76 years. Life expectancy of women in the U.S. is 79.66 years, while the EU 82 years. Women live longer than in France (84.86 years), Spain and Italy, and we noticed that they are above average and all other Mediterranean countries other than Croatian.
 Longest-lived men in Sweden (79.19), Italy and Cyprus, and from Mediterranean countries, only Slovenia and Croatia are below the EU average. Shortest living Lithuanians (66.29), which hold many other infamous record, and Latvians and Estonians, and of Romanian and Bulgarian women (77). Statistics 65 most common reasons for death, most residents of the hair above the Baltic countries and Bulgarians, Romanians, Hungarians and Slovaks, behind which is a pretty sick country of Croatia is coming. Mortality from cancer in the EU amounted to 172.7 persons per year per 100,000 inhabitants, is the most lethal cancer in Hungary (241.7) and Croatia (212.6). Also, the central government with 157.1 deaths from heart disease nearly doubled over the EU average (87.4), and is above average and deaths from chronic disease, liver disease and diabetes, while below average for mortality from pneumonia and diseases of the nervous system. Average deaths from AIDS in the EU is one per 100,000 population, while most in Portugal (6.3), and not at all in Slovakia and Bulgaria, while Croatia is to achieve a minimum 0.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, or ten times less than the European average.
 But why is Croatia, with a rate of 5.1, the acclaimed third place in the mortality from alcohol, behind Denmark (12.6) and Estonia (10.9), while, except France and Slovenia, all Mediterranean countries are negligible in the killing of alcohol, with rates from 0.2 to 0.3 percent in Malta, Italy and Greece. Croatia is at the top and mortality in accidents, with the rate of 39.5 compared to the EU 25, and fourth at the rate of deaths in traffic, behind Lithuania, Latvia and Romania. While the EU average of 8.9, Croatia in traffic losing 15 people per 100,000 population, a worrisome is that, unlike the Union, this number does not decrease for a whole decade. Croatian citizens obviously does not help the fact that they have 226 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants (as, for example, the level of Finland and more than Slovenia or Polish, but significantly less than the Belgian 405), and that they have only slightly fewer hospital beds than the EU average -a, and they can only bring comfort to the fact that the rate of 73.6 dentists to par with the developed countries of the Union.
 Causes of death should be added and the rate of suicide, which the EU is 9.8 per 100,000 population per year, with a minimum of suicide in Greece (2.8) and highest in Lithuania (30.7), while Croatia was seventh with a rate of 15 , 1 Finally, there is a rate of 1.6 murders in Croatia, which is 60 percent higher than the EU average. At least they kill each other Britons (0.4), Germans and Austrians (0.5), and most Latvijici (7.1) and Lithuanians (7.0), while the Estonians their record 13.6 in 2000. was able to reduce the preklanjskih 6.4. Regarding the cause of death, we can add that in European prisons spend an average of 123 persons per 100,000 inhabitants. Most in the Baltic countries (with a record 303 in Estonia), and lowest in Slovenia (60), while in Croatia the rate of 87th Culture and information on mobile phones and internet uvrh head of the Internet in the EU equipped 65 percent of households, and 50 percent RH. But while the Internet in the EU uses 60 percent of the people, in Croatia it uses 44 percent of the state of Croatian culture is poorly covered by the Eurostat statistics, no one can find the fact that the RH in the culture for two percent of employees, while the EU average by 2.4 percent (maximum of 3.8 in the Netherlands, and lowest in Romania 1.1 percent).
 Croatia in the number of students of architecture and journalism follows the EU average, but with 7 percent of the students of social sciences lags behind Europe 8.5 percent and 2.4 percent of students with art for the European 3.9 percent. Regarding the information society, the Internet is the EU equipped with a 65 per cent of households, and 50 percent RH, and 94 percent of enterprises in the EU, and Croatia as much as 96 percent. But while the Internet in the EU uses 60 percent of the people, in Croatia it uses 44 percent, making it better than only five countries. Internet use at least Romanians (31 percent), and most Dutch and the Swedes (86 percent). The share of people using the internet to communicate with the public sector in Croatia is 10.1 percent, and even 27.5 percent of the EU, which says a lot about the development of our public services. Croatian citizens with a 1.1 per capita cell phone are not much below the EU average of 1.22 cell phone, and it is interesting that I am not leading any Finns or Swedes, Greeks, but with 1.69 cell phones per person.
 Since the Austrians at the back of the scale (0.87 cell phone) and France (0.91 Mobile), it seems that this is not an indicator of development.
