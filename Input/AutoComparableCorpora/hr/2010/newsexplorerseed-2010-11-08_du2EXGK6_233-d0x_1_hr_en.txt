The United States and India &quot;are the two largest democracies of the world&quot; and share the responsibility &quot;to promote peace, stability and prosperity not only of nations but also the entire world,&quot; he added, according to AFP. The claim of India to become a permanent member of UN Security Council and Obama has said he would &quot;talk about it in the Indian parliament,&quot; Reuters, adding that such a requirement could counteract China.
