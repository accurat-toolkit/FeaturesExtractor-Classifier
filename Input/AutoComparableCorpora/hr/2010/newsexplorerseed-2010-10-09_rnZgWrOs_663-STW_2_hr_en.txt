Taliban representatives and Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai began secret negotiations at a high level of the war, reports The Washington Post. Negotiations followed previous unsuccessful meetings between the two sides, hosted by Saudi Arabia, which ended more than a year ago, reports HINA. Unnamed sources say that Květa Shura, an organization of Afghan Taliban based in Pakistan, is negotiating a comprehensive agreement that will include the participation of Taliban representatives in the government and the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces, according to the agreed schedule. It is believed that the Taliban began to negotiate for themselves know that the more radical elements of progress in their ranks and that are beyond their control. Afghan sources said however that Pakistan insisted on a central role in negotiations, making it difficult to talk Květa Suri. U.S. officials say it is time for real negotiations are only now arrived, and in turn remind analysts that the U.S. administration is under pressure to show progress in bringing the war before Obama&#39;s deadline to begin withdrawing troops in July 2011.
