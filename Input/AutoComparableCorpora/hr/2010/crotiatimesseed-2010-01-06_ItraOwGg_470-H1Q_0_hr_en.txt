Although the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of Yugoslavia passed twenty years, Croatia will be 10th January to choose between two candidates with the communist past. Their party&#39;s story in some ways mirrors the history of SKH-SDP and the beginning of a 80-s of the last century, when they both became members of the party, to this day. Ivo Josipovic, the SDP candidate, who comes from a familiar baškopoljske partisan and communist family, he became a member of the party at the end of the study 1980th, after the Yugoslav dictator Tito died. - After Tito&#39;s death, many people are enrolled in the party, we wanted to change things - explains Ivo Josipovic his youthful decision. Josipovic colleagues from the faculty, to recall some of them, why not act before it was open until the end. Nevertheless, Josipovic was politically active, despite membership in the party. It is not known, however, whether its membership in the party helped in getting the position of assistant at the Law School, but he was certainly helped along with a master&#39;s degree in law, get a more pleasant place for military service in Belgrade 1984th
 After training on mountain, he was transferred - the Yugoslav Army General Staff. Jobs in Hockey On the other hand, Milan Mayor studied political science at the Faculty of Political Science. During his studies, he worked through the student service and received &quot;Egyptian Vulture, and a scholarship by the Herzegovina municipality of Grude distributed to poor students. After his studies he worked in the ice, refrigerated. Then he went into the army he served as a military policeman in Zagreb.

A). 1981. he completed his military service and was inducted into the SKH. &quot;I joined the party in the local community nurses Bako. Honestly, this was partly due to ideas, and partly due to existence because I could not get the job, &quot;recalls Mayor Milan beginnings of its own party. After the initiation of the party, and Bandiću began blooming roses. The Ice got a job in administration, and 1983rd he joined the Municipal Committee of the SKH Peščenica, where he was professional and political activist for what, and CBS.
 - Municipal Secretariat for National Defence was led by a retired colonel of the JNA, otherwise the holder of partisan memorials, which was very rigid. As the colonel went into retirement, we took a chance and hired communicative Bandic. At work they have received the then leaders of the SK Peščenica, Miro Simic and Marko Ćustić and Ivo Radman, who worked in the Secretariat of National Defence and social self, and me. Enough of them were against Bandic, but we have been for him. It was different, communicative and eloquent. Mayor has a big heart and love for the city of Zagreb and its people - recalled Ivan Sikic, mayor Peščenica 1982nd / &#39;83. At the beginning of democratic change in the Mayor received an offer from the HDZ, but the smoother it is refused on the grounds that Croatia has in the SDP have an alternative. After that, the story had got involved important people in the Zagreb Party, Marko Cosic and Zdravko Tomac, who was Bandiću political science professor.
 - Ivica Racan 1990th we suggested Bandic, we pulled him out and brought in Pescenica SDP City of Zagreb, where proven - Tomac recalled. Mayor rapid progress is rapid progress in the SDP in the City - 1993. he became secretary of the SDP and, two years after the first time as a representative entered the city government, and the late 1997th became president of the Zagreb SDP. For five to six years he founded more than 200 branches of the SDP in the City. Unlike Bandic Josipović the 90-ies only briefly activated in the SKH-SDP. - At the invitation I wrote Racan&#39;s first democratic statute SDP - recalls Josipović. Mayor, however, his involvement in the SDP at the beginning of 90-they did not remember. - Maybe something for the private radio Racan, but he can not remember. As one of the leaders of the SDP in Zagreb, I would have known he was hired - said Milan Mayor. Zdravko Tomac said, however, that at the beginning of the 90s, the transformation in SKH SDP, led by sharp battle between two factions within the party - the Croatian and hardline.
 Carriers Croatian electricity, argues Tomac, were activists SDP and the City of Zagreb, a &quot;Yugoslav&quot; were in the party headquarters at Ibler Square. Tomce accusations - in 1992. Dalmatia in the pamphlet came out against me and Racan, accused that we are nationalists, &quot;the red Ustasha&quot; and attacks have continued and 1993. In the group of &quot;malcontents&quot; were Nikola and Zoran Viskovic Malek Faculty of Law in Split. They were joined by Feral Tribune. Josipovic was not conspicuous, but belonged to that group, and in 1994. left the SDP. He did not agree with Racan and me because we were too nationally oriented - Tomac said. His claims denies presidential candidate at University of. - I and the people, Viskovica and Malek, do not know. Tomac is deeply entered into a dirty campaign Bandic and as lying on the Z1 and newspapers, such as the Croatian newspaper, I wrote indictments against Croatian generals, so lying about my role in the transformation of the SDP.
 If I belonged to the option described by Tomac, would make me Racan called for MP? In fact, I advocated for better cooperation with the policy of the center-left, with Mike Tripala policy - responded Josipovic. He returned to politics 2003rd Racan to call and persuasion. He then became an independent deputy in the Croatian Parliament, a formal member of the SDP, he became before 2007. - Racan has pulled people &quot;out of a hat&quot;, like Tudjman, &quot;as experts and unencumbered. Milanovic was &quot;invented&quot; 2000th, and Josipovic and Jurčića 2003rd as a non-party people. He did not return to old people with old ideas. Out of a hat is actually pulled people that binds ambition - explains Zdravko Tomac. Supporters Bandic Josipoviću complain that he became a member of the SDP &quot;above&quot;, ie that he was &quot;given in succession, and the Mayor, an orphan,&quot; a must for all the bloody fight. &quot; &#39;RASTJERIVAČ darkness&#39; - Unlike his opponent, Bandic, who is my whole life was a party apparatchik, I have never been on any function in SKH - Josipovic responded to allegations of &quot;givens from above&quot;.
 - When Josipovic was born, but it was waiting for the piano, and the Mayor had to dispel the darkness, studying under candlelight - concluded Bandic a close relative.
