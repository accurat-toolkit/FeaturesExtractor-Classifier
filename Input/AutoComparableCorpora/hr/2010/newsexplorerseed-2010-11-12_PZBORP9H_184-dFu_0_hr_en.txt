Official officials say the epidemic spread of cholera in the capital Port-au-Prince, and the thing is, apparently, worsened last week&#39;s hurricane. Haiti: More patients (Photo: AP) Haitian health officials have warned in the first case of infection of cholera in the capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince. The news was confirmed by the ministry, but experts fear that the recent hurricanes may have helped spread the disease, which in the past month have killed close to 600 people. &gt;&gt; Haiti: Of 250 people died of cholera&gt; epidemic of cholera swept Haiti Haitian health minister Gabriel Timothee, said Tuesday that tests confirmed that the three year old boy infected with cholera in a tent camp in the capital Port-au-Prince. Timothee says the boy was taken to hospital last month, where was treated for severe dehydration and vomiting. Experts say the case is well worth attention, because the boy and his family were only in the hospital and did not leave the city within the last month, and therefore, had no contact with infected people who travel from other regions.
 For this reason, it is logical to conclude that the boy was infected in the hospital, which is officially the first case of the disease in Port-au-Prince. Potentially fatal disease was first detected last month in the Artibonite region, in central Haiti. Since then, 600 people died and hundreds have been reported cases of illness throughout Haiti. As the capital is concerned, so far there have been several people who were infected with cholera, and the inhabitants of the capital city. However, the experts were convinced that they get the disease while traveling to another region, then this is the first time that someone got sick in Port-au-Prince, bringing Voice of America. Doctors say he is one of the main causes of cholera contaminated water, such as the Artibonite River, which was contaminated with feces, and one of the few sources of &#39;drinking water&#39; in the region. Dr. Jon Andrus, director of the Pan American Health Organization, helping the Haitian government in the fight against cholera, said as the polluted water from rivers result of the hurricane which hit Haiti last week.
 &quot;We have every reason to expect that the very torrent of water increased the risk of cholera. The consequences of this will become clearer to us with developments in the next few days. &quot; News / World VIDEO: Miracle survived a terrible crash 12.11.2010 / 11:01 Americans tested the cannon that fires a projectile with speed ... 12.11.2010 / 10:41 survived fall from 12th floors and charged with attempted suicide ... 12.11.2010 / 08:15 Richard Holbrooke ended up in hospital, 11.12.2010 / 07:27 Sculpture 4400 years old sold for $ 16,800,000 10.12.2010 / 22:22 Damaged cruise ship happily sailed to Argentina, 10.12.2010 / 21:01 Share Leave a comment
