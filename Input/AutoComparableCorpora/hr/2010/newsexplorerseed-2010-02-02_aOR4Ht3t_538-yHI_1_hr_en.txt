Photo: AFP Nominations for this year&#39;s U.S. Academy Award film science and art that may not be too big a surprise because as it usually happens, which preceded the award given fairly clear view of potential nominations. Foreseeable or not, this will be primarily a very interesting fight for the gold kipiæe among the nominees because they found that nearly all those who really deserve and you operate, which makes this year&#39;s Academy unusual choice of &quot;understandable&quot; to those who follow the race. There is also a good balance between large commercial and independent films that is also a great search for refreshment. However, little objection could go in the direction of nominations for best song, but that already belongs to the award, tentatively put, &quot;less important&quot;, which is primarily the result of long-standing practice of choosing the total drloga. But this year we have a &quot;real&quot; race among the truly best. Best film: The real view from, the expected battle is between those pairs of departure of the former Cameron / Bigelow or &quot;avatars&quot; and &quot;Sergeant James&quot;.
 However, if the party removed the visual bravura of James Cameron, the rights to the struggle waged between the &quot;Sergeant James&quot; and all others (except &quot;The Blind Side&quot; whose only quality le ¾ and performed by Sandra Bullock). Specifically, &quot;is&quot; reasonably bears the title &quot;great&quot; films that deserves ¾ Uje admiration, if they&#39;s nothing else then because of the special effects and success at the box office, but the story was weak and below the surface lies a little of this and really it may deal with the rest of the nominees. Curiosity among the nominees for best film and certainly the appearance of a cartoon, &quot;Up,&quot; which with &quot;Avatar&quot; animated duo makes this year&#39;s award. Serious pretenders are certainly &quot;Sergeant James&quot;, &quot;Up in the air&quot; and &quot;Precious&quot;, and is realistic to expect that they will &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (despite the fact that it is one of the best films of Quentin Tarantino), &quot;A Serious Man&quot; and &quot;An Education&quot; will remain deprived. Best Actor: Briljant Jeff Bridges likely choice of the Academy and there really should not be too many reasons for dissatisfaction as Bridges to deserve you Uje not only because of the fact that for oskarovske nominations regularly been deprived already, and because this is one of his best roles.
 Moguæa threat is definitely a Jeremy Renner, although in this situation, all options are open. Specifically, Firth, Clooney and Freeman made the role of bona fide and would not be surprised if one of them himself as a winner, but you deserve to Bridges Uje thanks to a memorable role as a failed country singers Scott Cooper in the movie &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;. Best Actress: The actress, things are not so simple. On the one hand we have two veteran, Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep are proven oskarovski material, on the other two young actresses who have just appeared on the radar, but left the impression of excellent - and Carey Mulligan Gabourey Sidibe. In the middle is Sandra Bullock who was released from ¾ romantic comedy genre, and delighted both audiences and critics. Many anticipate the success of Carey Mulligan, who has already dubbed the new Audrey Hepburn. The same goes for newcomer Gabourey Sidibe, which definitely did not named the new Audrey, but their interpretation has left many breathless.
 Predict the winner is almost impossible, although it would be good in a big way to introduce young actresses who have shown a remarkable talent. Best Director: Cameron, Bigelow, Reitman, Tarantino, and Lee Daniels enthralled the audience, each in its own way. Here comes again to express ¾ aja fighting Cameron-Bigelow, but everything indicates that Bigelow could lose the most. Her work on the film &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; is definitely the perfect material for an Oscar, but we should not ignore the &quot;Up in the Air&quot; which is the mnogoèemu one of the biggest surprises of last year and no doubt you&#39;re Excellent Iran dramedija. Daniels entered a small film, but we should not ignore the &quot;Juno factor&quot; is applicable here. Tarantino acting as a director with the least chance even though you deserve an Oscar Uje more than Cameron. You could say &quot;everything is possible&quot;, but doing that would Tarantino could be too much for the old guard. Best animated film: he would expect &quot;Up&quot; to pick up an Oscar for best film is very unrealistic expectation, but in the cartoon category, things are different.
 There are &quot;Up&quot; makes a most likely winner. Of course, bona fide &quot;Coraline&quot; by far the best animated film among the nominees as at the end of may and it will not to mean much. &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; and &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; have their own attributes, while &quot;The Secret of Kells&quot; in this society operates as an outsider with the least chance. Best Supporting Actor / Actress: If things worked fairly, Christopher Waltz was the only nominee for best supporting actor as accomplished is one of the best performances of last year glumeæi psihotiènog, but intelligent &quot;Hunter ® Jews&quot; in Tarantino&#39;s &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. Stanley Tucci is the only good thing in a pathetic film Peter Jackson&#39;s &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;, but the role is not so memorable, even though many Tuccija put on a list of the best villains. In the end, neither Plummer, neither Damon nor Harrelson simply can not compete with Hollywood&#39;s biggest discovery of last year.
 On the opposite side, Mo&#39;Nique acts as the likely choice of the Academy, and Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick shine in the Great &quot;Up in the air&quot; so there is a possibility that they will at least pick up a prize. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a surprising nomination, but says the odliènoj about the role that should not be underestimated. Penelope Cruz is still a danger, but her Oscar would be a kind of insult to the far greater competition. Best Original / Adapted Screenplay: The case of Kathryn Bigelow to lose in all other categories, the Academy Award for best original screenplay could end up in the hands of its screenwriter Mark Boal as a kind of apology. A similar outcome could happen and the brothers Coen, whose &quot;A Serious Man&quot; in the best case acts as a silent threat. However, everything indicates that this category will take the fight Tarantino and Bigelow. Adapted screenplay is completely another story, because the &quot;Up in the Air&quot;, &quot;District 9&quot;, &quot;An Education&quot; and &quot;Precious&quot; is only &quot;in the loop&quot; is doing as &quot;æorak.
 But the Academy loves indie projects and the British political satire could surprise many. &gt; Other comments by you can read here Share
