Sexy. Phones. Hungarian. Can the DJ-ica and &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate Metzker Viktoria (b. 1987). Be higher (summer) cliché? Can. Well, for starters, ridiculously cute Viki is not acting in her topless as some older teammate Niki Belucci. Secondly, recently became a brunette. But, butt, waist and her breasts are like the hourglass. In the latter part of the body Viki is superior to Niki. A DJ-strengthening? It was not until we see them at work, sorry to hear. It will be damn hard cock ears. Just as you, dear readers, is certainly not easy to read even this lively &quot;summer reading&quot; and not throw around the image. What, still reading? A musical role model? Madonna! - What was your first memory of music? It was a moment when I saw Madonna&#39;s concert on television! I remember it very well, and my mother made all her tapes (laughs). At the time Madonna was my favorite singer and musician! - Is there a chance some kind of music you hate? Frankly, there is no style that I do not like, but my greatest love is a house! And yes, while I ride in the car, I like to listen to funky (laughs).
 - Why DJING, not singing? Surely you, the looks, songwriter left speechless. (Laughs) Good question. Interestingly, you really did sing, that I then began to DJ-ati! Six years ago I had a &quot;girl&quot; group, four of us girls ... Unfortunately, it did not work, it was difficult for us to combine work and learning. And, of course, we were too young. Only a few of our songs were recorded, and then thrown into the basket. - What makes your style of DJing unique? Uniform? Hmm ... I think it is very important that the DJ, so I, radiates an aura of her! Also, the key thing is that he loves what he does and that people feel while playing for them. - Can you single out one party that you stayed in the most memorable? What made him exceptional? Now I&#39;ve already gone through the world and everywhere I have become richer by a great party, so it was difficult to extract one! But I can say that the most fun audiences Japanese and Korean! Their hands were all the time in the air with joy! I will never forget.
 - How much you should exercise to achieve a professional status that you have achieved? I started DJ-ati 2006th Before that, I learned a lot about the profession. Every day I would have learned something new by watching and listening to the DJs at parties. Then I had a residency at one of the largest and most famous clubs in Budapest, &quot;Play&quot;, which was my springboard, while at the same time I did a tour of Hungary! A year and a half my career has erupted outside the borders of Hungary. I was in America, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, Turkey, Ibiza, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, France, Italy, Poland, Germany, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia, Switzerland, Slovakia, and finally, Croatia (laughter) . I think it&#39;s cool references (laughs). Each party was to me a good lesson for the future. - Before you how many people played the most so far? Biggest crowd ... Maybe at one of the most famous Hungarian Festival, &quot;Balaton Sound&quot;! Because, eight to ten thousand people visited the festival every year where they played and David Guetta, Carl Cox, Roger Sanchez ...
 Finale &quot;Miami Winter Music&quot; was also great to experience the huge auditorium. - Your music is heard around the world. Do you feel the differences between audiences in different countries, such as Croatian? I think the love of music the same everywhere in the world. I have already played several times in Croatia and I have not noticed any difference compared to the rest of the planet. This summer I&#39;m off to a lot of parties in Croatia in one of your best clubs. I am very excited about that (laughs). - What would be your main advice for young DJs on the rise in the terms of reference that you yourself started? Huuuuhhh ... A difficult question (laughs). However, here are: respect for the older, more experienced DJs, lots of learning and practice and, of course, draw lessons from your mistakes! - What do you do when they do not engage in music? I ease up with your boyfriend and his family (laughs). My favorite part of my body? Lice! - If you had to choose the three best songs in the past few years, which would have been? Sorry, I&#39;ll choose five pieces, because I have so many favorite songs (laughs).
 Year 2006. Till West &amp; DJ Delicious &quot;Same Man&quot; - with this thing, I truly fell in love electro house, great vocals. In 2007. I would single out with Roger Sanchez &quot;Release Yourself&quot; (Compilation 6), Thoroughbred house the largest house possible on the world. Steve Angello &amp; Laidback Luke feat. Robin S. Show Me Love &quot;would set aside in 2008. - Whenever that song is released worldwide, the party would be perfect! Last year, my favorite is the Swedish House Mafia &amp; Laidback Luke feat. Deborah Cox, &quot;Leave the World Behind,&quot; a worldwide hit and superstvar, and this year, 2010., My sympathy has Eddie Thoneick &amp; Erick Morillo &quot;Nothing Better&quot;, the maximum frontrunner now (laughs). - What is the biggest misconception the public in connection with Viktoria Metzker? &quot;When I called the owner of the club, the first time I think I&#39;m just a nice girl that will appeal to boys. After you finish playing, I realize that the party was perfect, and called me back ( laughter) - When Viki looked in the mirror, you see exactly? See 23-year-old girl who, despite a young age, has already achieved many things about which he dreamed.
 - Does Viki favorite part of your body? I do not think (about) anything &quot;dirty&quot; by that, you just have a favorite body part you like to see in the mirror? Ha-ha! Well, now I&#39;m a little zarumenila (laughs). In fact, I do (laughter). But if you just have to say, it would then maybe my face! - Are you more the type of girl you like cocktails or beer, spirits ...? Cocktails! &quot;Sex On The Beach&quot; is my favorite (laughter). - If you want to feel sexy, just put on a short or something? Clothing is not important if we want to be sexy (laughs). In fact the only guy we can help, but I will say that (laughs). - Do you use sex, sex symbol title, as a weapon? I do not think I&#39;m a sex symbol (laughs). If people think I am, OK, I&#39;ll feel good about it. Every woman likes to be flattered (laughs). But, no, I do not use sex appeal as a weapon. - Anyway, how much success attributed to the fact that you&#39;re sexy? Do you think you curves can distract from the music? How do you turn, I have very good feedback of the audience and the profession! I won the award in Hungary, for the discovery of DJ 2009th
 year! I received the first award as a woman in my country in the DJ business. I think it&#39;s great recognition. Although, admittedly, many owners of clubs today is not so important that women are &quot;just&quot; beautiful. If you do not know a good party, do not call over and buried her career, especially if you are not playing topless. Generally, 80 percent of female DJs are DJ topless-ice. There are no longer working primarily on music, more nudity. I do not like it ... - Have you ever dreamed of performing topless? Never! - Are you afraid of age, you people one days will no longer be viewed through rose-colored glasses sex symbol? If someone is not only beautiful but also talented, then why does not the strepjeti. I was young, enjoy life, work ... For several years I would like to start a family. Basically, I&#39;m not afraid of aging, it is inevitable years of life. MARKO NJEGIĆ 10 short-order Viki in short lines described Viki? - I love my job and I&#39;m right radoholičarka (laughs).
 It is easy to make friends, I love to laugh, and if someone I love, I will give him everything! - What you can make them laugh? - My little puppy, pug, I can still laugh. -What is your ultimate fantasy? - Long-term career, health, happy family one days with my boyfriend (laughs). -When you first entered the long relationship? - My first serious relationship began five years ago. We are still together! - Sexiest surprise that you have prepared a guy ...? - Have to keep my sweet secret (laughs). - Ganja Are you paparazzi? - Nooo, I think the real paparazzi live only in America (laughs). - What puts you in a good mood? - Good music, good joke or a good movie. -Megan Fox has said she &quot;wants a bit of Olivia Wilde? You? Who is your favorite woman? - Madonna, a true icon that always renovates itself. Impressive! - Are you a vicious turkey? - I am not wicked, just mischievous (laughter) - Beautiful and smart.
