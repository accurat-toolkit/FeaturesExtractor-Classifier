Glory be to Allah alone. He is Lord of all that exists. Let&#39;s blessings and peace be the last Poslanka, leader of the Faithful and his family, companions and those who follow their example of charity to the Day gathering. Let&#39;s continue ... Example Before we begin, I will mention a few examples of Arabic words that I used in today&#39;s lecture: Allah-literally means God, the One who deserves worship, Quran-the last submission in accordance with Muslim tradition, the last word of Allah. Sala Allahu &#39;alayhi wa sallam, peace be upon him-you hear me pronounce this phrase after the name of the Prophet, and that means some are Allah&#39;s peace and blessings be upon him. Introducing Today&#39;s lecture will be an educational discussion. But also it will be useful for us to learn about each other&#39;s beliefs, as scholars, both former and current, said stem-hatred is ignoring. Jesus in Islam is known as Jesus - that name was given to Jesus in our manuscripts.
 For Muslims, Jesus or Isa is a savior, a reformer, the Messiah (miropomazani), the Word of God, he was raised to heaven. He could heal the sick, raise the dead, and shapes of inanimate things that breathe life into them by the will of God. We believe that whoever does not believe in Jesus is not a Muslim, because the person who does not believe in one of the deputies do not believe in one of them. So Muslims believe in Jesus and his revelation. His revelation is the same as all the other prophets. The Quran is said that God never sent a prophet to mankind with another publication with the exception of warning - Worship Allah alone. Muhammad, peace be upon him, said, &quot;is worth more than Jesus, the son of Mary in this life and beyond.&quot; Companions he was asked: &quot;Why is it so, O Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him?&quot; He, peace be upon him, replied: &quot;Letter to the brothers, their mothers are different, but their faith is the same.&quot; (Bukhari) Therefore, this entails that one that denies the validity of one of the true prophets and messengers that he actually denies them all.
 An individual may not believe in Muhammad, peace be upon him, not believing in Jesus as the same, one can not fully believe in Jesus, as, and does not believe in Muhammad, peace be upon acceptance of a true prophet or prophets entails acceptance of all of those who came before him and those who come after him, ending with Muhammad, peace be upon him My lecture today will cover four main points: 1st round Mary? - Prior to consideration of Jesus in Islam, we must first know the status of Mary in Islam 2.Bezgriješno Conception 3.Posebne properties were bestowed upon Jesus by Allah as a proof of the basic humanity of divine revelation 4.Muslimanski view of the &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, and what what comes after that. 1.Merjem (Mary) daughter of Imrana One of the most touching and naupečatljivijih mother-son relationship in the Qur&#39;an is the Isau, son of Mary, as the first and last time in history, a delegate is not addressed by the name of the father. Moreover, as indicated by Jesus - the son of Mary.
 To procijenilii and understand the true virtue of Jesus&#39;, it is essential that we learn about his mother, Maryam, daughter Imranovoj, as Mary&#39;s mother was at an advanced age when she got pregnant. She prayed to God to give her last child to be given to God&#39;s service. When conceived in advanced age, she said, as recorded in the Qur&#39;an: Allah has chosen Adam, and Nuha, and the family of Ibrahim, and Imranovu family over the rest of the world - all the labor of one another - and Allah is Hearing, known. When TNT&#39;s wife said: &quot;My lord, what is in my belly is just vow to serve you, so accept from me, because You, really, all you hear and know!&quot; After it, when the father, said: &quot;My Lord! , I gave birth to a female - and Allah knows what she bore - &quot;A woman is like a man; nadjela Merjema to her name, and I her and her birth place under Your wing of the accursed Satan.&quot; I received her Master&#39;s nice to do that ages beautifully, and that it cares about Zekerijja .* Whenever her Zekerijja entered the temple, and she would find food.
 &quot;Where did you get this, O Mary!&quot; - He would have asked, and she would answer: &quot;From Allah, Allah is the one who wants hassle-free supplies.&quot; Ali &#39;Imran, 33-37 When Mary&#39;s mother gave birth, she was sad she gave birth female child. Because according to Jewish tradition, there are only a few religious rites of commitment to God that a woman can perform. Of 514 acts of devotion, only 4 may be performed by Jewish women. She called the child Maryam, meaning &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;one who is purified&quot;. Allah has accepted a young girl in his office, and chose Zekerijju, and Zechariah, to be the one who will take care of it. Zekerijja is one of the prophets in Islam. He was elected clerk of all of the time, who were gathered and taught how to throw his pen into a river. They were told that the pen which is opposite boat river flows that will be her protector. Zekerijjino pen is opposite boat rječnoj current. O Mary, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: &quot;The four best women in this world are Maryam the daughter of &#39;Imran; Asija, wife of Pharaoh, Khadijah, daughter Huvejlidova and Fatima, daughter of Muhammad.
 The Prophet, peace be upon him, also said about Maryam: &quot;At birth each child Satan touches him, and then the child cries, except Maryam and her son.&quot; (Transferred Ahmed, Muslim) Allah says in the Qur&#39;an: &quot;And when the angels said, : &quot;O Maryam, Allah has chosen you to create a clean and better than any woman in the world did.&quot; Ali &#39;Imran, 42 Therefore, Maryam was selected from all mankind that Jesus is born, and Nineteenth sura of the Qur&#39;an is named Maryam, and is dedicated to her story and the Immaculate Conception. 2.Bezgriješno conception in the Quran, Muhammad, peace be upon him, was told to learn the story of Mary: &quot;I mention in the Book of Mary: when a family member on its eastern side and pulled a curtain to be taken out of shelters, we have her angels Jibril and sent her on display in the form of a perfectly formed man. &quot;It affects the Merciful from you, if you fear Him!&quot; - She cried. &quot;And I just envoy your Lord&quot; - he said - &quot;that you worship the boy&#39;s clean!&quot; &quot;How can I have a boy&quot; - she said - &quot;when no man touch me not, and I&#39;m not naughty!&quot; It is so! &quot;-&quot; he said.
 &quot;Your Lord said: &#39;It is easy for me&#39;, and therefore making it so people sign and symbol of grace Our. Thus, the predetermined &quot;Maryam, 16-21. Jesus is called &quot;word of God&quot; because Allah says, &quot;We&quot; and he did. Allah sets on the parable of Jesus and Adam - Adam is made of earth, not born from the womb women. Allah says: &quot;Isaov case is the same as Allah and of Adam of the country it was created, and then said:&quot; Be! &quot;- And he would.&quot; Ali &#39;Imran, 59 Jesus had no father. But that does not mean that the divinity of Jesus and that is worthy of worship, because the existence of Adam&#39;s major miracle of Jesus. Allah also says in the Qur&#39;an that Jesus and his mother became tired, and that they need funds for living. Therefore, they can not be a deity. The story of the Immaculate Conception is continuing in the Qur&#39;an: &quot;And she carried away and tend to be far more weighty negdje.I prisiliše labor pains to come to a palm tree.
 &quot;Would that I had died and that I completely fell into oblivion!&quot; - Exclaimed ona.I the angel, who was below her, called out: &quot;Do not be, your Lord has given you to lower the stream flow.&quot; Maryam, 22-24. Jesus spoke to Mary as a miracle from God to tell her not to be afraid and do not be sad. Mary was instructed to return when the family does not correspond to either of their question. So when faced with her, she is shown to the child. They asked, &quot;How can a child speak in the cradle?&quot; Then the baby Jesus spoke and said: &quot;I am the slave of Allah&quot; - what he said - &quot;I will he give the Book and the messengers of me to do and will make me, wherever I am, blessed, and we will order it while I&#39;m alive prayer and charity to impart, and that his mother be good, and will not allow me to be daring and nepristojan.I peace over me as when I was born and the day when I died and on the day when I get up from the dead! &quot;This is the son of Mary - this is the truth about him - the one in whom they suspect.&quot; This is the story of the Immaculate Conception to what we are told in the Qur&#39;an.
 3rd Special features of Jesus Immaculate Conception is just one of many miracles that Allah gave to Jesus. According to Islamic sources, Jesus began as a shepherd, like all the prophets were before they received the revelation. Jesus knew the Torah, and could read and write even as a little kid. Jesus grew up knowing his cousin Yahya / John the Baptist. Both together will refer to the worship of God. Jesus never said - &quot;Worship me&quot; - it is not appropriate any of God posalniku. Jesus lived a full life, against him, fought and hated him and scolded different enemies, including all the bad habits of that time, all those who wanted power and status. Scholars argue that every Prophet and Messenger sent with some sort of evidence, a sign which would make their people responded. During the time of Moses, as, magic and illusions were widespread and falsely attributed to false deities.
  Briefly we start to discuss complications that Jesus saved from the Jews and Romans. The verse also shows how the Jews who sought Jesus&#39; death, not the Romans, so to speak. The verse also shows that Jews are those who believe (havarijuni or students) and those who did not believe. &quot;And when I ordered the disciples:&quot; Believe in Me and My Prophet! &quot; - They said: &#39;We believe, and you are to be witness that we are Muslims&#39;. &quot;This verse clearly shows that Allah controls and instruction instills in the hearts of individuals. There are those who reject the truth after they have witnessed these miraculous events. Instruction is clear from Allah, as is the misguidance of those who tried to reject the truth and the light of tawhid. And when the disciples said: O Isa, son of Mary, can you give us your Lord dining table from the sky down? &quot;- He said:&quot; Fear Allah, if you are believers. &quot;Although the view that a bird made of clay is being revived, they are blind and lepers cured of his weakness of, standing dead and many other miracles, they still said, &quot;Is your Lord can.&quot;
 The very syntax of their words imply that if your Lord not to let down our table, then he can not, not that you do not want to! &quot;We want&quot; - they said - &quot;to eat with her and that our hearts be calm and to make sure we&#39;re speaking the truth, and to be witnesses of it.&quot; Again, the weakness of their faith is obvious. The syntax of their statements imply that if you tell us the truth and if you really prophets and messengers, then your Lord will give us lower the dining table as we requested. Otherwise you&#39;re not telling the truth. They acknowledge that their faith is weak. Isa, and, therefore, invokes Allah to place dining table: Jesus son of Mary, said: &quot;O Allah, our Lord, drop us a festival to be our feast, and the first of us and those later, and the miracle of yours, and feed us and You are the breadwinner of the best! &quot;This request, however it seemed simple in comparison with other miracles worked by Jesus, as is quite a different nature.
 Request the students &#39;challenge&#39; Allah. Sufijan et Tevri, ra, says - &quot;The feast day which means we mark the day of Thy worship.&quot; Selman el Faris, RA, said: &quot;The day that we commemorate remembering you.&quot; Allah said: &quot;I&#39;ll drop you&quot; - Allah said - &quot;but I will one of you and after they are sentenced believe what anyone in the world not to punish.&quot; Abdullah bin &#39;Amr bin al&#39; Aws, ra, said: &quot;Three people who will most be punished on the Day of assembly will be: licjemjeri (at the time of the Prophet), they are after they descended uznevjerovali table, and Pharaoh and his legions. &quot;4 The Muslim view of the crucifixion of Jesus, God saved for the end of time. Allah says in the Qur&#39;an: &quot;And because of their saying:&quot; We killed the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Allah&#39;s messenger, &quot;And they slew him not nor crucified, but they seemed. Those who were about him in opinion diverged, they themselves are about the doubts were, about anything not reliably known, only speculated, and it is certain that he was not killed, but Allah raised him to Himself.
 - And Allah is Mighty, Wise. &quot;An-Nisa, 157-158. Jews and Romans were joyfully announced: &quot;We killed the Messiah!&quot; But they killed him not nor crucified, is saved by God and raised to heaven. Allah says in Surah Ali-&#39;Imran, 54-58, &quot;And the unbelievers began to concoct schemes, but Allah is removed, because he knows how to najbolje.I when Allah said: O Jesus, the soul will take you to Himself, and raised ik and Spasic and from the disbelievers and will make your followers are all over the infidels to the end of the world. Menu will be, after all recover and I&#39;ll tell you about the one in which the judge did not agree: those who do not believe the terrible pain I put on this world and the next one and they will be able to help. ... And to those who believe and do good deeds, He will give them full reward. - Nasilnike.Ovo Allah does not like what you are telling Qur&#39;an verses and wise. We, Muslims believe that one day the Antichrist will come and then Jesus would be down from heaven and will kill the Antichrist, to live among Muslims, and that will govern them.
 During this period the country will be filled with justice and prosperity. Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: &quot;And then will the country say: &#39;penetrate the fruits, and decorated the bereketom. Then they will eat the whole group from a bar and will fit in the shade of its bark. The milk will be a blessing. One husband&#39;s background will satisfy the people gathered, and a dairy cow - the entire tribe, and one sheep milk cows will satisfy a branch of the tribe. While they are also lived, Allah will send them a fragrant wind, so it will touch them under their armpits and soul of every Mumin and every Muslim to take. Only the worst people will remain, which will open zinaluk do, how to make the donkeys, and they will pour the horrors of the last day. &quot;(Narrated by Muslim) Muhammad, peace be upon him, said:&quot; How glorious will be the time when Jesus is lived among you will plant the seeds of the reactive rock and it will ponići; will be drought, plants will cover the earth, man would be able to sit next to a lion and will not harm him. &quot;(Narrated by Ad-Dejlemi) Jesus will come again, will be married, will have children, will live for 40 years between us.
 And after he dies Judgement day will come. Conclusion Allah swt says: &quot;They say:&quot; The Merciful has taken a child! &quot;- You, indeed, say something disgusting! Almost to the heavens apart, a country breaks and mountain crushed the Merciful attribute child. It is unthinkable that a child is merciful - that they will all, and those in the heavens and the earth, as slaves to seek refuge in the Merciful! &quot;Maryam, 88-93. Allah swt says: &quot;Allah did not take to Himself a son, and with him there is no god! Otherwise, any god with what he created - does what he wanted, and another one to beat. - Praise be to Allah who is far from what they amount to &quot;Al-Mu&#39;minun, 91 There are more similarities than differences between Muslims and Christians. According to Islamic law, have special rules for the &quot;followers of the Book&quot;, which are similar to us except a few minor differences in the major areas of dogma. It will be concluded with the following words: &quot;Say: O followers of the Book, come to gather around a word to us and you shared: that no one except Allah does not worship, that anyone like him do not consider that to each other, besides Allah, the gods do not stick! &quot;Well, if they do not agree, you say:&quot; Be witness that we are Muslims! &quot;Ali &#39;Imran, 64 Source: Islaam.net Islambosna.ba To translate: sister Zinaida Retrieved from IslamBosna.ba Filed under: Islam and other religions and belief systems | Tagged: Allah, Christ, Islam, Jesus, Quran, Muhammad, Prophet | Leave a Comment »
