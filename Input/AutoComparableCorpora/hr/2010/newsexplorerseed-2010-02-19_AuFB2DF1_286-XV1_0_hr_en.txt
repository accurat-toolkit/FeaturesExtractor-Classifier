The mere announcement of the meeting the American president and leader of Tibet has caused anger and opposition to China. Specifically, the Dalai Lama, Beijing considers dangerous separatist, which promotes the independence of Tibet. A decision of the United States, or President Obama to receive the Dalai Lama to the White House for China is a big blow, because this country is Tibet still considers its historic province. At the end of January in Beijing is once again a meeting between the Chinese Government and representatives of the Dalai Lama, but China&#39;s government has strongly rejected the autonomy of Tibet. The Dalai Lama, who since 1959. He has lived in exile in India, repeatedly emphasized that &quot;wants to secede Tibet&quot;. China should not fear, or? Although China is the United States threatened sanctions against U.S. companies in the country, an expert on Tibet, Thierry Dodin, believes that there is actually no reason to fear: &quot;In politics, especially in Chinese politics there are always different address.
 The Chinese government has long been known to meet Obama and the Dalai Lama. Of course, they are glad when heads of state talking with the Tibetan leader, but also know how against it can not do anything. Negative consequences, in my opinion, it will be. &quot;Before the flight to Washington, the Dalai Lama would not give any information about the content of conversations with the President. According to the staff of Tibetan leaders in Washington will not be held or shared public conference of the American president and leader of Tibet. Author: DPA / MLJ Re. Editor: S. Matic
