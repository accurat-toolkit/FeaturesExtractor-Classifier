 June held in Vodice, within the CMC festival, to once again celebrate a birthday with the audience. • Do you have tired so many times to celebrate a birthday? - When a band manages to take so much, it really deserves much celebration. In doing so, we do not do any Kerefeki. Just come on stage, play and sing along with our audience. As for our 25th birthday, and myself is a little strange when I turn around and realize how many years have passed, and we&#39;re still here. On the occasion of the birthday we published our 25th album called &#39;Do not love&#39;. We think that even the name of the album talks about what has given us in our work and persistence. Indeed, there was no love, there would be no red apple, no songs, no audience. • What is you favorite song on this album? - Each of these songs for me has special meaning. The album is a total of seventy-seven songs, of which nine of the audience has not heard in our performance, such as &#39;Ballads&#39; group of Kelly Clarkson, &#39;DIRLIJA&#39; in which a guest home, &#39;Easy Money&#39; ITD band, &#39;While Miljacka flows&#39; from the movie &#39;Ghosts&#39; ...
 • the date on which bore red apples? - We gave birth to several months, but it can be said that the month of our birth rujan 1985th year. • Was it painful to give birth? - If it is, we have to, like most mothers, but forgot. • When you describe what you are all done over the past quarter century, what would you say? - He would say: It was all music. We are already in a serious band for years and have reached the ripe age of majority. Everything was there, and the beautiful and difficult moments, but remembered what was left, and it&#39;s free. • The audience is always with you, but your waist, according to Porin, not exactly prone. - Well, I am now talking about Porin because I&#39;m afraid I do not have anything nice to say about this topic. • What do you say about Porin? - And what can I say? Honorable exceptions, but few real hits and the real songs, which are at this event last year deservedly won. During these 18 years that I live in Croatia and how the Porin award, it was really a lot there, and proclaimed ovjenčanih songs and hits that most people did not know and sing.
 • How is the Red Apple has received the Porin? - So far, no. And do not be surprised if so continue. Instead of Porina, we got a lot of concerts and crowded gym. We are not alone. In the &#39;neporinovskoj&#39; category are some performers who have performance to spare, but the lack of Porina, like Colonia and Jasmin Stavros. They say that the Porin award profession. Fine. It might not be bad to us &#39;unprofessional&#39; then just throw when us anyway, as far as recognition, not to notice. • A year and a half, you have become the father of twins, Peter and Maree. Does your family suffers because of your job? - No. I think it would suffer more if I worked in the office of 9-17 hours and returning home dead-tired. Thus, if I&#39;m on the road, then my three girls know me at all, and if I&#39;m home, I then dad 24 hours a day. I run the clinics for a walk, go to the store, and sometimes even cook something that would facilitate women. • While your wife Barbara was pregnant, you said that you yearn for a girl and a boy where did you already chosen the name.
 Do you still feel sorry for you at home, instead of Peter, you do not have Rocco? - Whatever. Roko will now wait, and his girlfriend would not swap it for a hundred sons. • Who are the girls? - Everyone says that the dad. • Do the hair like Daddy? - They have a lot of hair, it could be something about to make. • Hairstyles and Stark are your trademarks, despite the attempts of stylists who are crying out for updates to your head and legs. - Will continue to cry out, in my opinion. I will not be some kind of silicone types of identity and change the contents of my closet. I am a member of the jeans generation, and I feel great shoes, and I think the audience does not mind. In vain all these stylistic wonders if you do not have a song. I have songs, but I do not have a stylist, and will remain so. • What can we expect from a red apple in the next 25 years? - I do not know how much we are consuming. I would really like to have your words of gilding, again speaking for 25 years, then to celebrate our 50th
