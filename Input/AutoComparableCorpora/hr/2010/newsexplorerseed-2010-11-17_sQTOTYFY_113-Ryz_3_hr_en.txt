The situation in Ireland is not harmless. &quot;That&#39;s what happens in that country, and even Greece does not help the Croatian bonds,&quot; says the Business Journal correspondent who traded those securities. However, yields on bonds are not Croatian has recently changed significantly. Spread on our five-year eurobonds are now around 300 basis points. Any disruption in the financial world, especially in Europe, is almost always reflected in Croatia. The situation with Ireland and the possible consequences of the &#39;periphery&#39; of Europe (Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Central Europe), a sufficient reason for caution. Since the middle of October, the spread of Irish bonds from 370 basis points, compared to the German Bund, the peak was at 650, and is now about 500 basis points, &quot;said party business. But, recalls that while the Irish spread spreads, our not, you actually wonder. &quot;There are several reasons why this is surprising.

He points out that Croatia has five bonds on foreign markets. Given that one is due in March, we have really four active. Good macro-economic &quot;It is very little of the bonds issued in relation to other countries. Also, because of these problems, investors have decided to switch his focus on the countries of Central Europe because there are things &#39;shaky&#39;, and this part of Europe now is not that interesting. For now, the situation is not so bad, but enough is a bigger problem and it can turn around, &quot;said the source. Macroeconomic data are going to hand us. According to the share of public debt to GDP in Croatia is in a better position than these countries. The share of net public debt is around forty percent, while in Greece three times higher, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.
 Ireland, however, last year accounted for 36.4 percent of net government debt to GDP, while the next should be 55.2 percent. Domestic bonds (4 billion), which is expected, &quot;the market will easily &#39;swallow&#39;, the system is highly liquid, the banks &#39;not where the money&#39;, and there is a low interest on the money market,&quot; explains the source of the Business.
