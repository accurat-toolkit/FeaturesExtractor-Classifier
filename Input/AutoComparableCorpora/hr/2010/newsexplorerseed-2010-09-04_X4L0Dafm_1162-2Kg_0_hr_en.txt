SANTIAGO - NASA experts who were invited to assist in the rescue of 33 miners trapped in mine Chilean miners have rejected pleas to bring them alcohol and cigarettes. The miners, many of whom were heavy drinkers, they asked that their alcohol and cigarettes, sending the three inch wide opening that their only link with the outside world. But a doctor from the U.S. space agency immediately rejected that idea. - From the point of alcohol, before we decide anything, they must first pick up food, &quot;said James Michael Duncan, deputy chief physician NASA. Instead of wine required, the miners, who have since the beginning of this difficult ordeal has lost about 10 pounds, in narrow plastic tubes sent to foods rich in protein and calories. Cigarettes are considered bad for their health, but were given nicotine patches and gum to help them cope with withdrawal symptoms. Despite this bad news, miners welcomed the arrival of four NASA experts.
 - Miners exploded with joy when their engineer explained that they came only to work on their case, &quot;says Juan Fernando Acu√±a, Executive Secretary of the space agency. - They began to sing the famous Chilean national anthem. NASA experts are satisfied with how it handled the situation, as well as the strength shown by the miners, he said. NASA will use technology developed in space miners to simulate day and night. Supposedly will be invited celebrities, especially the Chilean soccer players, to raise the spirit of the miners. - These miners have shown us the exceptional strength in survival as much as they could without any contact with the surface. What we want is to try to avoid any situation of hopelessness, &quot;says Dr. Duncan. The miners were trapped 700 feet underground in a mine in San Jose in the Atacama desert of 5 August. On Friday came another machine to expand one of the channels for the supply, while drilling holes for the rescue continued after the 10-hour interruption.
