Assistant Secretary of State, Jeffrey Fejtman, said that Washington seeks explanation from Damascus, and that what he called, &quot;The United States considered all the options in this case. It is, however, refused to say whether the U.S. can not confirm that such transfer weapons actually occurred. Previously, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, rejected accusations that Israel was first presented as &quot;an attempt to find a pretext for a military coup.&quot; threat that Lebanon now has a large rockets are similar to those that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.
 Israel is trying to replay the same scenario in Lebanon, &quot;said Saad Hariri. Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. The long war that killed more than 1200 Lebanese, mostly civilians. During the conflict, 160 Israelis were killed most of them were soldiers.
