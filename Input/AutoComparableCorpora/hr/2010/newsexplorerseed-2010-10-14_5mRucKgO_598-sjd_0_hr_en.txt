Lately, we were able to hear many rumors about how Apple with all those thinking that their money buys Facebook, Sony, Adobe ... But Apple has never had a major acquisition, up to now has always had a tendency towards smaller technology acquisitions. The latest rumors about Apple&#39;s interest to buy this BOKU, startup that specializes in mobile payments, it fits into that pattern. As it stands, Apple is very interested in paying via mobile phone and that could be a huge opportunity for Apple in the coming years. Imagine that your iPhone is your wallet? Turning cell phones into wallets was a dream of many companies for a long time, but Apple is in a unique position to pay via mobile phone finally realized in reality. Apple is already dealing with payment via iTunes, which has 160 million active accounts. PayPal has only 90 million. Payment would probably began with digital goods, music, movies, applications and the like.
 Apple already does all of this today via iTunes, which is one of the best systems of aggregation of micro-transactions. What if you could pay and micro-transactions from their phone bills as easily as you do with your credit cards? Over time, this payment method could be extended to digital and virtual goods to purchase in the real world. If Apple ever truly decides that his next step is to enter the premises to pay via mobile phone for sure that he could become a very significant player in this space.
