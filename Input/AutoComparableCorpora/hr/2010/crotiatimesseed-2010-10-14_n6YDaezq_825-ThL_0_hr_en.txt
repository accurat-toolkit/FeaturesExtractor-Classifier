Council for National Minorities has been temporarily suspended funding 13 of 92 minority associations, because they did not submit a financial report for the first six months of this year. It is about 11 Roma, an association of German and one Russian national minorities, which have for their projects from the Council received a total of almost 240 thousand, but not justify spending that money. Council President Alex Tolnauer explained that this body can not tolerate indiscipline associations, and complained that some NGOs warned that breaking the law, but that still refuse to deliver the report, because they believe that it is too little money and that it should not be justified. He announced that the Council of the association to send surveillance, and if necessary, to file criminal charges. Roma representative Nazif Memedi suggested that these associations that additional period of 15 days to submit a report, said that the association did not come upon a new form of the Council.
 At the Council meeting was presented and Research Faculty of Political Sciences on the functioning of councils and representatives of national minorities, which is listed as a problem of poor minority interest for the election of minority councils and members, and insufficient involvement of the very councils and representatives of national minorities. A third of the elected councilors and representatives do not participate in the work of local authorities, there are only occasional meetings of the municipal and city councils and never proposed any measure to improve the status of minorities. Council members therefore concluded that it was necessary to further educate the council and representatives about their roles, but also minorities of their rights. The Council was warned that Parliament should adopt a law on the financing of coordination, the Council and representatives of national minorities, according to Hina.
