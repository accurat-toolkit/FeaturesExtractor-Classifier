For example, the United Kingdom has the overall rate of 17.5% and there are two reduced rates of 5% and 0%, and Poland, which has a general rate of 22% applied three reduced rate 7%, 3% and 0%. Coverage of the zero-rate VAT in EU countries is generally limited to products and services listed in Annex III of the Directive, which is otherwise permitted use of reduced rates. These include products and services: Interim provisions of the EU Directive stipulates the duration of the zero VAT rate. So Cyprus is their right to zero rate on supplies of some foods and beverages as well as the delivery of pharmaceutical products, drugs and vaccines not be used until 31
 December 2007., Malta is a zero rate on food products and pharmaceutical products could serve to 1 January 2010. year. Interestingly, Cyprus and Poland remained the postponement and cancellation of the zero rate for longer: Cyprus to 31 December 2009. and Poland to 31 December 2010. year. Poland can still apply a reduced rate of not less than 3% on the delivery of food and other reduced tax rate of 7% on providing services that are not part of social policy, in the construction, renovation and redecoration of living space, with the exception of construction materials, and delivery, before the first settlement, residential buildings or parts of residential buildings.

Zero VAT rate in Croatia is applied from 1 November 1999. year, the domestic supply of bread, milk, books, and some drugs and medical supplies.
 In June 2000. The expanded product categories covered by the zero rate to scientific journals and public screening of films. From 1 January 2006. Croatia has introduced a reduced tax rate of 10% on accommodation and tourist accommodation with breakfast, half board or full board in all types of commercial catering facilities. This rate of 10% applies to agency services (commission). All products and services that are applicable in Croatia zero belong to categories of products listed in Annex III of the Directive, for which the EU offers the possibility to apply reduced rates, but not less than 5%. At the time of the reform of the tax system 2006th in some transition countries have introduced a flat tax (flat tax rate for income tax and VAT), which is in Croatia at that time began to think about that idea, but it was dropped. In terms of the zero-rate VAT in the European Union, we can conclude that the rather strict European rules and that is targeted to complete abolition of these rates in the European Union.
 Room for exceptions is extremely limited, both for the products covered and their duration. The Republic of Croatia before the imminent entry into the European Union, so it will be necessary and we make certain changes in the VAT rate. One should re-examine the importance of the zero rate of VAT to the categories covered by the product and seek a temporary postponement of the abolition of the zero rates for most product categories. In this way, we think, to avoid a one-time impact of price increases due to the abolition of the zero rate.
