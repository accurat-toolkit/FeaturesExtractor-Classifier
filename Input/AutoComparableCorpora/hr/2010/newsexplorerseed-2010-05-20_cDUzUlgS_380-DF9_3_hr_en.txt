Recently, the driver could not start the vehicle when the Taliban at a village in the area of Mazar-e Sharif attacked a group of Afghan army, trained by Croatian troops, according Jutarnji list. After they returned to the attack, the Croatians managed to save the car, fix it and get away to safety. A spokesman for the MoD confirmed that Goran Grošinić problems with vehicles, but denied the information that the LMV scheduled in the middle of a battle with the Taliban. LMV was stopped during the recent operations of NATO forces in northern Afghanistan in which he participated and the Afghan army and Croatian instructors who train them. At that time there were no shootings, says Grošinić. The problem, according to him, too weak in the alternator on a vehicle that can not supply all the current devices that are installed on the vehicle. This is the radio stations, air conditioner and communications system. Apart from Croatia, this problem occurs and the other hosts who use this vehicle.
 The problem arose on several occasions and the Minister of Defence Branko Vukelic ordered an urgent resolution of the problem, most likely a stronger alternator installation. The upgrade will include all nine LMV and by HV currently in Afghanistan and at the expense of the MOD. Specifically, for this type of failure can not call the manufacturer because the vehicle is subsequently ugrađivani additional devices that consume higher power than the limits for which the manufacturer guarantees. These events imposed by the responsibilities of individuals within the military structures that are allowed to the LMV incorporate additional devices, although they knew in advance that the specifications of the vehicle can not handle it. Such a decision in a direct threat led troops in Afghan terrain. (JL)
