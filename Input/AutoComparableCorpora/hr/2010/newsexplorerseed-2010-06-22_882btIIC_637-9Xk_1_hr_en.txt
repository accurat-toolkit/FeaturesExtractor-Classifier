The trial of France and South Africa in Bloemfontein was the last appearance for one and the other at the World Championships. A last group are Uruguay and Mexico, but the mood in the camps was the opposite. Bongani Khumalo, South Africa&#39;s national team: &quot;We knew what we do today. The early goal helped us and it is very important that we are able to continue to play on the wings of that leadership. I was convinced that we will achieve the desired goal.&quot; From disgraced French coach Raymond Domenech said goodbye to refusing to shake hands Carlos Alberto Parreira, his colleague on the bench of South Repblike. &quot;I do not intend to explain why I did it,&quot; the short was a French strategist after the game. Parreira tried to throw the least glimmer of light on the incident: &quot;I think it&#39;s because I criticized France after a controversial passage through the qualification. I can be quite sure, but so are my assistants said Domenech.&quot;
 As regards the match, the hosts have entered an important victory, but without a final celebration. &quot;I&#39;m proud of my guys. They made this country proud and show them progress,&quot; commented Parreira. Interestingly, and Domenech has had kind words for his football players: &quot;They showed heart in the field, fighting and real fighting spirit.&quot; &quot;I am sorry about what happened here, both for himself, and because all French people,&quot; concluded Raymond Domenech.
