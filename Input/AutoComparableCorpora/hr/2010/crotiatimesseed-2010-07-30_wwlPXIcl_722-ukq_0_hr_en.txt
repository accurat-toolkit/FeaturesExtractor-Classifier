One was born on 30 June and another first srpnja 1953. years and both now have 57 years and 27 years of service. Although the old law, both could retire at age 2013th was filled with 60 years and 15 years of service, according to the new one will be able to go into retirement on the last day 2015th and the second just seven months later. An average of 60 years in the EU Namely, since the first January 2011. gradually increasing the age limit for women going into retirement for six months each year she was born first July for just one day later births will have to wait an additional seven months of retirement.

 Gradually increasing the age limit women since 2020. The early retirement of power at the same time as the men - with 60 years of age and 35 years, and old-age pension from 65 years and 15 years of service. In addition, five years early retirement in the future will be penalized with a permanently reduced pension of 20.4 percent. The same percentage of the reward will be five years longer work. At the moment in which one Croatian Pensioners supports only 1.29 employees, while the share of the annual pension cost of 35 billion in GDP last year grew to 10.5 percent of economic experts estimated that the restrictions in the pension system were necessary.

The same trend is expected by the end of this year, and it is estimated that the new legal restrictions from next year, however, gradually reduce the significant influx of new retirees. - And the new amendments to the Act on Pension Insurance Government as the main criterion for the retirement age is determined, not seniority.
 It sets the whole system upside down because the only aim to prevent the inflow of new pensioners, rather than looking up what kind of pension they have. Gave me a retiree who is 62 years and 42 years of service and he has three years can not be the old age pension, and someone who is 65 years and 15 years of service at a time in old-age pension - warns Željko Semper, one of the leading experts in the Croatian Party of Pensioners .
