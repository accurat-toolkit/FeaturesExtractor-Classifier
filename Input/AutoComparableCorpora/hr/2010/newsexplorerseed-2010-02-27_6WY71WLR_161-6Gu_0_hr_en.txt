Never buy the X-nation first few weeks when they have new collections! To give you a mistake number one. Error number two is closely related to the number one mistake, and that is to overpay a piece of clothing. The key to success is patience. Of course, there is a crucial outlet where the most expensive piece of clothing costs EUR 150.00. Uh, I love when I find something I like and then look at what a price four times sni≈æavano anyway &#39;almost worthless! :) As for the quality, colors are very persistent and so far I never happened to the paint washed, even after several years. The design is more classic, here and there some combination that can be called unusual, but mostly the classic Furaj. pants never buy there, somehow I too go to the carrot. As far as I know unless they have clothes and shoes and leather goods (handbags, belts, wallets, gloves ...). Xnation card is another benefit that can be achieved.
 Every purchase you collect stamps and signature of the seller. After a set amount of 1,000.00 HRK you can get a card with which each of the next purchase will receive 20% discount. And then your purchase really has no end ... :)
