&quot;They are, in my opinion, put up for sale. I have over many years was an opponent of that bank that small countries have foreign owners,&quot; said Honohan. Irish government has already announced that it will boost banking sector reform, including reducing the size of the domestic banks. Analysts, however, indicate that the conditions for the sale of these assets are limited and that any sales were at prices lower than the actual value, or would require the government to cover potential losses. Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kes de Jager has warned that any consolidation of the Irish banking sector will be painful. The United Irish Bank (AIB) have already been sold valuable assets in Poland and the United States, and last week they stopped selling its operations in Britain due to a lack of interest, recalled Reuters. Analyst Gary McCartney Stuart Collins in the company pointed to a statement Honohana could signal something more dramatic, such as a full sales AIB.
 Honohan also said he expected more additional conditions to the agreement on the program of financial assistance, why it considers that the fear and mistrust in the financial markets because of the conditions of the agreement were unfair. He added that the support of the IMF needs to increase confidence in the markets.
