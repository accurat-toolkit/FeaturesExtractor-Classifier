Naoto Kan will become the new Japanese prime minister after his Friday ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has chosen its new leader, reports agencies. Kan (63) was the deputy prime minister and finance minister in the government unpopular Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyame, who on Wednesday, after almost nine months in power, resigned because he did not fulfill a promise to relocate a U.S. military base in Okinawa. Channel selection as leader of DPJ&#39;s key is in the process of his appointment as prime minister because the ruling party has a majority in the lower house of Japan&#39;s parliament elects prime minister, reports the agency dpa. Kan will become Japan&#39;s fifth prime minister in the last three years. The main challenges his government will fight with a large public debt and stimulate economic growth and strengthen relationships with the strongest security ally of the United States, and a large force in the rise of neighboring China. &quot;I want these elections to the new leaders are beginning to create a strong Japan and how I want to take the lead,&quot; Khan said his party supporters ahead of voting on which was overwhelmingly defeated his only opponent, little-known 50-year-old lawyer Shinjija Tarutoka, Reuters .
