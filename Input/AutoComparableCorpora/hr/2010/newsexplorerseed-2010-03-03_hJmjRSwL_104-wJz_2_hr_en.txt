Further to my previous post, to draw attention to this morning in the WSJ article, which discussed the theme customization competitiveness euroised economies. As a &#39;teaser&#39; only mention this &quot;Any benefits of devaluation would be quickly offset by rising wage and other costs, leaving the country more or less back where it started, at the cost of extreme financial turmoil. The implicit conclusion for Greece, Spain and others is that, to compete with Germany, they have to have a flexible labor market and should introduce other changes to boost the supply side of their economies. ... The country most likely to leave the euro zone is not Greece, Spain or Portugal-but Germany. &quot;In this connection, I am obliged to write even another part of the text &#39;End of History&#39;, which is also the second part of the previous text, which shows that resolution to the situation in Hrvtskoj has good prospects, and why it is worth investing in shares of Croatian.
 ps It is interesting that neither the author nor the other did not notice an interesting new paradigm, I&#39;ll call it &#39;target devaluation&#39;. Uncompetitive Greece, Spain, Portugal and others threatening the euro, which recently intensively depreciates (seems to be supported by intense speculative hedge funds), paradoxically making the whole of Europe more competitive!
