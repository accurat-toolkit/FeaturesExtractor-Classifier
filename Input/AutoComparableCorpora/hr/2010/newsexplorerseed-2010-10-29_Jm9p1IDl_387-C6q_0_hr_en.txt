On the completion of the trial of three &quot;Croatian generals.&quot; The 3rd 09th 2010th Formerly General de Gaulle in one of his confrontation with the Americans said that &quot;Americans are a nation that has stepped out of childhood into senility, and that it has not gone through adulthood.&quot; And we are a nation of Croats who can not seem to get out of childhood, not to step into adulthood, when we need a &quot;father&#39;s homeland,&quot; let us fiddle with the sale of fairy tales of our glorious victory and pride, because there is no djetinjastije statement than: &quot;I am proud I am a Croat mother, thank you! &quot; We as a nation we just went through a stage of purification, a catharsis, as it is now fashionable to say so and continue in their journey saplićemo of illusions, imaginations and a platitude that we are endowed &quot;fathers of the homeland&quot;, and today we hired their apologists, who are working and immature nation came in power, reach limits of their own incompetence and steadily lead the people and the country straight into the abyss.
 A people without intellectual leadership, because the few intellectuals of the names of those who wanted to speak honestly, calling things real name, just the start neuter, disabled and discredited, and many are caught in a network of national mythology, and themselves on laprdaju &quot;magnificent&quot; victory and similar nebula. A nation can not go through a catharsis, if he does not furnish true and if things do not call the right name, it can only continue to sink into despair and lethargy. But when the very people among the elite inetelektualnom where it should be a duty, but really rare individuals, there are those who would be able to create that &quot;critical mass&quot; that could affect the consciousness and conscience of the nation, then pointing the eyes of someone outside waiting for help osvještenju. The latest is our chance tribunal in The Hague, for his verdict on the three generals depends much more important for the mental hygiene of the Croatian people.
 Political and intelektalna nomenclature in Croatia is strongly pointing to convince people that it was a &quot;political court&quot; who &quot;tried to the Croatian people and state&quot;, of course, just because we are &quot;presumed to destroy them so popular Yugoslavia against their will (sic) to create independent Croatian state, &quot;which they, paz&quot; Now, &quot;an eyesore&quot;. No one asks if we really &quot;dared to destroy Yugoslavia, then why for the demolition of constantly accuse Milosevic? Why accuse Serbia of aggression against Croatia, and Croatian &quot;Vrhovnik&quot; never for aggression was not indicted Milosevic, the man who had practically absolute power in Serbia? Why, despite all of Tudjman&#39;s statement about the Serbs in Croatia as a &quot;disturbing factor&quot;, which is &quot;redundancies&quot; Croatia can not &quot;breathe with full lungs of a free Croatian air, so that their number should&quot; be reasonable &quot;in any case under 8% to lose the status of &quot;significant minority&quot; and possible minority rights that such status brings, do not admit that Tudjman sought to get rid of &quot;excess&quot; of the Serbs, and that it could not just war and that is in agreement with Milosevic? Etc..
 etc. .... So if the court in The Hague with its verdict the existence of the CPA, led by Tudjman, then let&#39;s obezvrijeđivati efforts invested by the court to prove the truth, and truth which we store in the subconscious, but she, burdened declared truths, do not let see the light of day. Can you even eventual conviction of three generals to be the &quot;trigger&quot;, which will first intellectual elite, and then people make them reconsider their views on certain events from the recent past and distancing himself from the truth and proclaimed by the political elite that it &quot; truths &quot;constantly bombarded with and does not allow&quot; revision &quot;of history, a ghost proclaimed the truth? I think I should not say that olobađajuća verdict delayed even possible to pass through the catharsis of the Croatian people for an indefinite time, as they proclaimed the truth were accepted as absolute, then God help us or not. Otherwise, the question really is, that Tudjman and Susak in life, whether the three generals in general was accused of, or be judged only Tudjman and Susak as the main generators of evil in Croatia?
