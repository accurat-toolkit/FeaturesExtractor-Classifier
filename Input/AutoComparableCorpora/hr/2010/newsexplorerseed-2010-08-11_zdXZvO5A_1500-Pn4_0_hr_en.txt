&quot;Ok! Aleppo!&quot; - Spoke to the driver somewhere around half 12, and we poluusnuli, exhausted all the stronger sun unloaded from the car and found on a wide boulevard, to say no idea where we are in Aleppo. Somehow we dogegali to the bench in the park and went to trial folder. A few laps around the city later, we knew where the street with the majority of budget hotels, we had some Syrian pounds (in fact, Syrian lira, but for some reason the English translation of &#39;pound&#39;) and a fantastic cedjenih blackberry juice in the stomach. We soon found it unsightly, but fairly inexpensive hotel, and that was not center on the roof, we have thrown in a double room. Our hotel is located in a street tire - that is, every street that has shops in it, often themed - all stores selling soap, or spices, or hookah, possibly punctuated by stands with food (felafel, svarma) - our street is, therefore, there was a big tire shops - car, bus, truck, tractor, bicycle tires, and at the end there were several actions that are sold all over the bikes.
 At the next corner, which was much more attractive for us, was the end of the sellers of fresh fruit juice - from bananas and oranges, and peaches over the apricots, blackberries, apples - definitely the best juice I drank. And not expensive - 25 pounds to your thermos filled with a half-liter and still get a free glass of drink on the spot. First afternoon in Aleppo passed in drinking these drinks, walks around town and ended up being a nice dinner in a restaurant under the vines by the name &quot;Al Chabab&quot;, which is to say &quot;guys&quot;. Finally klope excellent (we even drank beer and - and one of 0.75 l, with a quite decent) we got a plate of icy watermelon, which was pinned to the restaurant business card with a message nazvrljanom in French: &quot;C&#39;est l &#39; hospitalité du Restaurant Al-Chabab. Somewhat later, pleasant blanket whom we asked where to find net-cafe took us to the secluded streets and, as it turned out, the cheapest net-cafes in the city.
 The next day, we started from the museum, met with a charming bronze lion and several zivotinjki that reminded me passionately on the &quot;endless story&quot; that I was otherwise something in his head during the whole time. Story about her and her conclusion in the future to tell later. After the museum, we went through the alley and jumped us was a man with a question - &quot;Slovenia&quot;. He was even happier when we say we are from Serbia, he immediately started to talk about &#39;general Titus&#39;, and explained that he was very evil of Milosevic&#39;s death. We asked him politely explained to us, not exactly - and what else continued to Caska, in a mixture of Serbian and English. He suggested the exchange - a few old Syrian and Lebanese coins for a new Serbian, I have not had a reason to refuse, and then offered to carry us through the city. Aleppo is famous for the manufacture of soap, so we started from the end where the right to sell a plain exterior, but very fragrant, and when cut, intense emerald-green, olive soaps.
 From there we made a brief visit to the ice factory (a huge icebergs, which nosaju around one hundred trucks, one hundred chariots, one hundred bikes - especially the necessary vendors fruit juices), drank tea, talked, we said goodbye to the old diesel nemackom machine that runs the whole thing, again politely explained clearly disappointed that Serbia hosts the bass and not abundant ice factories and continued on. We found a quarter of the blacksmiths - from swords to less prominent pieces - parts for machines of unknown function. Now in addition, decorators copper vessel, and shortly after the discovery that turned out very useful in the rest room - a kiosk with the local Master om-Cola and Cheer-up to, the price of 5 pounds - some 7 Serbian dinar. After besomucnog painting, I am no longer had a place on the card and that he reaches a new (and not the last) section of the story Atreja / Bastijana: One of the most exciting idea, at least for me, which figures in an endless story, was that the deletion of memories for the sake of fulfilling cabbage (boy Atrej or Bastijan, or perhaps another on the way to become the first - get the necklace, uroborus is a symbol that represents, which allows him to fulfill his every wish in fantasy land, but at the cost of erasing the memories of some memories, the idea that In fact mint covers vast similarities and vast differences finite and infinite - as memories of the final, but things that actually occurred and greens, as infinite, and of course their zamenjivosti, but only in the direction of the infinite, ie, transforming memories into a new, and thus the new until then, endless, infinity, and parce only infinite, it becomes just another experience, bounded by time and space, the main human dimensions.
 Sentimentality is related solely to the things that we cherish, not for those that have not yet experienced and it makes the transition and its jednosmernost painful, otherwise, in a large panorama, it would be anyway. I do not know if I explained well how I perceive this, nor will it be able to understand anyone who did not read the book (I think that the original idea for the book, it did not borrowing from some of the mythology, like most things in the book which certainly, and yet, regardless of age, I recommend), but this I am told since I was first there in Aleppo faced by deleting the memories as something that is really going on. Of course, delete the photo does not mean that some experience has not happened, that is disappearing memory of the place, but this is still some way to delete, even a symbol, a memory. For the first time, gazing into the camera, thinking that it erases the pictures - I felt transported in the days and places that were different enough from everything in the previous life iskusenog, it could represent a kind of fantasy, and I&#39;m wiping the memories that I put new ones that took place there in front of me, as it would not happen if the victim does not do this - delete some previous ones, that would otherwise remain poluformirane, neizdvojeni part of an unknown infinity of impressions in front of me, and next time, but seconds away and from that poluartikulisanog court awareness, perhaps the only connection you have with all the potential I feel, even those that exceed the scope or amount of an average kalibriranost heard a variety of memory and sensory perception.
 Somewhere in a dream I jerked himself, potrazivsi from Ali to take me to some actions where memories are transferred from the card to a CD, and then the first time I really regretted a photo as such, and perhaps sebosvojstvenosebicno, because I am able to that product. This is one reason (other when the time comes for them), which on this occasion I send a few &quot;memories&quot; and only one extremely nonspecific and quite another final. We parted from Ali and went to the huge databases of the park in the northern part of town. On the edge of magnificent park came in nondescript cages in which he sat and played a huge baboon with a scale model of an American aircraft - a bunch of local kids is shared our enthusiasm. After sugar bombs (huge ice cream and a coconut cake with pistachio nuts, cashew nuts and almonds), we went to visit my church and the mosque in an attempt to find the entrance to the large Orthodox church, we ran a few kids who in the back yard playing football.
 After an hour running after the ball at the worst sun around 3 this afternoon, I was najzedniji in life (at least by then) and terribly glad that the head can fit under the faucet. We learned later that it was 45 degrees. A little rested, we went back to look for Ali. We entered by a seller jermenskog silverware, whose action is but showed little earlier as we passed street. We chatted with him, watching what has to offer, and yellow, in passing, stopped But with the next, the unforgettable words: &quot;Mr Harac, good man - not expensive.&quot; The rest of the day we enjoyed nibbling on bread and trgicu we had excellent views from Harac actions.
