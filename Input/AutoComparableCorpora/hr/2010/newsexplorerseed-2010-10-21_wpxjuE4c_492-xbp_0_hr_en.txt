The war in Afghanistan has now entered its tenth year. He became the longest American war. Until 7 October 2010. year, the ninth anniversary of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, the human cost of war Afghanistan is estimated at about 4.9 million violent and nonviolent deaths caused by poverty imposed by the occupiers. US-allied Afghan Holocaust and Afghan Genocide has now reached the dimensions of the Jewish Holocaust of the second World War II (5-6 million dead, 1 of 6 dead of poverty). Normal people from all over the world must continue to vigorously oppose this hideous violence of mankind. To aided the normal people, I have prepared carefully documented information leaflet deaths in the Afghan war is set below, where the latest information to 7 October 2010. 1st Post-invazijske nonviolent deaths caused by poverty - 3.7 million total.
 [1]. 2nd Post-invazijske violent deaths - a total of 1.2 million (taking into account that the level of violence in the Afghan war was 4 times lower than in the Iraq war in the Iraq war, the relationship between violent and nonviolent deaths is 1.3 million). [1,2,3]. 3rd Post-invazijske deaths of infants under 5 years of age - total 2.6 million. [1]. 4th Afghan refugees - a total of 3.2 million. This includes 2.7 million in Iran and Pakistan and 0.4 million displaced within Afghanistan. [4]. 5th Exile caused by U.S. and Pakistani bombing in northwest Pakistan - 2.5 million Pashtuns. [5]. 6th Annual deaths of infants under 5 years in occupied Afghanistan - total 311 000, of which 90% is caused by the war-imposed poverty. [6]. 7th It is estimated that the annual death rate of infants under 5 years of age 7%, and comparisons to the Nazi-occupied Poland, the rate was 4%, and French Jews in Nazi-occupied France 5%.
 [7]. 8th Annual expenditure on health per capita, allowed by the occupying forces in Afghanistan are $ 29, compared with $ 3122 for occupied Australia. [8]. 9th Expected life expectancy at birth m / f (years): 42/43. [8]. 10th Expectation of healthy life in 2003. year, at birth m / f (years): 35/36. [8]. 11th Probability of death before 5 years (per 1000 births): 257 [8]. 12th Probability of death between the 15-and 60-year, and m / f (per 1000 population): 500/443. [8]. 13th The percentage of children under 5 years who were suffering from backwardness in development (2003-2008): 59%. [6]. 14th Adult literacy rate: in both men and women (2003-2007): 29%. [6]. 15th Maternal mortality rate (annual number of deaths caused by pregnancy, childbirth 100 000): 1 800 [6]. 16th The death of American soldiers in and around Afghanistan in the Afghan war - a total 1 246 and the death of Australian soldiers - totally 22nd [9]. 17th Around 100 000 people die from drug-related death every year.
 US alliance regained the Afghan opium industry with 6% of the world market in 2001. year as the Taliban ruled, on 90% of the world market today. Therefore, one can calculate that - 0.1 million people per year x 0.9 x 9 years = 0.8 million people died worldwide because of the US-allied Afghan restore opium industry, which the Taliban destroyed. This includes about 100 000 Americans and about 3 000 Australians. [10, 11, 12, 13]. 18th Nobel laureate in economics, Professor Joseph Stiglitz (Columbia University) and Professor Linda Bilmes (Harvard University) have estimated the real cost of Iraq war just over $ 3 000 billion, with huge impact on oil prices, war in Afghanistan, the U.S. federal debt, state debt by injured veterans, the global financial crisis and U.S. recession. Dr. Michael Intriligator, a senior associate at the Milken Institute, an American, has suggested a long-term cost of the war in Afghanistan to 1 500 billion to $ 2 000 billion.
 Australian involvement will cost about $ 1 billion annually. [14, 15]. 19th Perverse financial diversion for the Afghan war continue to have fatal consequences in the United States and other countries, America&#39;s allies such as Australia. Thus, it is estimated that about 1 million Americans die each year from poverty or violence (eg, 30 000 Americans were killed with weapons each year, 44 million Americans live in poverty and the difference between the rates of infant mortality between Singapore and the richest country in the world, America, shows that about 20 000 American infants die each year). 9 000 Aboriginal Australians die each year from the total Aboriginal population of 0.5 million, due to living conditions as well as in third world countries and 2 to 3 times lower for Aboriginal fondiranja of Health (currently a year set aside a $ 1.5 billion should be allocated 3 to 4.5 billion dollars annually).
 [16, 17, 18]. 20th Terrible financial sabotage the war in Afghanistan (and Iraq and indeed throughout the world) led to a global mortal holocaust is still going on, where it is estimated that 24 million people die each year from poverty (16 million in 2003).. [19]. 21st Man caused global warming is the main problem of humanity, together with nuclear weapons, and poverty. Huge financial abuse in the war in Afghanistan are mutulate political will of America to address climate change caused by man. Dr. James Lovlok MRC (Gaia hypothesis) and Professor Kevin Anderson (Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research University of changes in Manchester, UK) recently estimated that less than 1 billion people survive this century because of global warming, a tie which is the cause of man - Please note that it is expected that world population will reach a figure of 9.5 billion by 2050 years - this assessment translated into deaths caused by the genocide of climate changes mean the death of 10 billion people this century.
 This includes 6 million children under 5 years, 3 billion Muslims in the final Muslim Holocaust, Indians 2 billion, 1.3 billion non-Arab Africans, 0.5 million Bengali, Pakistani 0.3 billion and 0.3 billion people of Bangladesh. Nation to reduce pollution by harmful gases in as soon as possible within and to really reach 100% renewable energy by 2020. If the world wants to have a 67% chance to avoid 2 degrees of temperature rise (estimate Professor Hans Joachim Å elnhubera, leading the Potsdam Institute for climate impact research in Germany) are really the worst polluting countries, mainly America, Canada and Australia. &quot;Annual pollution from greenhouse gases in units of&quot; tons of CO2 equivalent per person per year (data from the period 2005-2008) is 0.9 Bangladesh, Pakistan 0.9, 2.2 India, (less than)
