The new data may indicate that 152 million to 317 million gallons of oil run out in the Gulf of explosion and fire on the platform of the Deepwater Horizon 20th April, a lower estimate is almost four times higher than the oil slicks resulting from 1989th, after the Exxon Valdez tanker grounding off the coast of Alaska. VIDEO: Oil still goes up in the Gulf of Mexico (10.06.2010.) Higher estimate of the amount of oil that flows from the well, said Marcia McNutt, director of the American Institute of Geological Research. She noted that an estimate of oil before cutting the pipe at the exit from the well at 1500 meters depth, which could increase this amount. The revised numbers were the latest in a series of estimates increase steadily since the scientists analyzed video footage of oil spills. The first estimate was 1000 barrels per day, then BP is a long handled with data on 5000 barrels per day, that the government&#39;s scientific team raised the assessment on 11000-19000 barrels per day.
 The same group of scientists has now concluded that &quot;given the limited data available and little time to process these data, the best estimate for the average flow of oil spills ... between 25000-30000 barrels per day, but it can be a minimum 20 000 bpd or a maximum of 40 000 barrels a day, &quot;McNutt said in a published estimate. BP has announced that it will not be able to close the hole before August, when it will be completed, two parallel wells in the same reservoir of oil. The dome, which last week laid over the damaged hole, catches of about 15,000 barrels per day, which are pumped into the tanker on the surface. Officials predict that corporations will next week be able to double that amount, and a portion of oil burned on the surface. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, who commands the federal government&#39;s efforts to curb pollution, has asked the government Thursday of BP&#39;s appropriate to send a delegation for talks in Washington.
 The American TV network reported that the president Barack Obama in next Wednesday to meet with the director Tony Hayward and other leaders of BP&#39;s in the White House. Obama&#39;s family on Thursday received 11 victims of explosion on the platform of the Deepwater Horizon. BP estimates that so far spent 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in response to the oil stain and the amount will probably rise substantially over the payment of claims by injured parties and lawsuits. Oil giant agreed Thursday to speed up payments to people who threatened the livelihood of oil slicks, which has closed 31 percent of the Gulf of Mexico for fishing, and left without many tourist resorts along the coast. BP announced that it has so far disbursed more than 53 million U.S. dollars to 20,000, of 42,000 claims. Previous articles: Journalist plunged into an oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico (09.06.2010.)
