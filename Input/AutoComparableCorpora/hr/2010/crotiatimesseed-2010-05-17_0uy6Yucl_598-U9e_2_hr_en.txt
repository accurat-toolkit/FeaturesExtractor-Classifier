Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the committee of finance ministers of the eurozone, he tried to reassure markets about inflation, noting also that the euro remains &quot;credible currency&quot;, despite the debt crisis that erupted because of countries like Greece. &quot;We believe that a credible euro currency, price stability is fully preserved in the eurozone over the past 11 years, and as such will be maintained in the years ahead. This is the main feature of the euro and a big advantage for investors,&quot; said Juncker.
