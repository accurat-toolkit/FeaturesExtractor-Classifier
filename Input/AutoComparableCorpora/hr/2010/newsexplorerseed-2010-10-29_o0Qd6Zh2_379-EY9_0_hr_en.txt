Specifically, the Senate - the upper house of the French parliament - approved a controversial pension reform project initiated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Senators voted for the document which, among other things, provides for increasing the age for retirement at 62 years, the age limit for obtaining full state pension moves from 65 to 67 years. For legislative proposal is 177 senators voted in favor and against them were the 153rd The French government has resolutely defended the proposal - by emphasizing the need to preserve prezadu≈æenog pension system from collapse.

Otherwise, the French police on Friday to remove blockages of major refineries, but the unions do not give up and announce new protests. On Friday morning, a day after unions called for new general protest 28th October and 11th November, the police removed the blockade of one of the key refineries in Grandpuitsu near Paris. Unionists have said that at least three people were injured in a shoving with police. Police officers carried out a government order to force strikers who have camped for days in front of the warehouse again to start the work of the refinery and the establishment of fuel supply. It is a command that can be issued when authorities estimate that the strike is a threat to public order and peace. It is binding on strikers to return to work under the threat of prosecution.

However, surveys on Friday announced Canal Plus shows that 70 percent of citizens still support the strike.
