&quot;He jumped the gun, partly because we now live in this media culture where something goes up on YouTube or a blog and everybody scrambles,&quot; the president told &quot;Good Morning America.&quot; Obama, who called Sherrod to apologize for the White House&#39;s overreaction, said he hopes members of his administration can learn from the headline-grabbing controversy of the past few days. &quot;I&#39;ve told my team and I told my agencies that we have to make sure that we&#39;re focusing on doing the right thing instead of what looks to be politically necessary at that very moment. We have to take our time and, and think through these issues, &quot;the president told ABC. &quot;If there&#39;s a lesson to be drawn from this episode, it&#39;s that rather than us jumping to conclusions and pointing fingers at each other, we should all look Inward and try to examine what&#39;s in our own hearts and, as a consequence, I think we will continue to make progress, &quot;he said.
 Vilsack also personally apologized to Sherrod and offered her a better job at the Agriculture Department, but she said Thursday she has not decided whether to accept. Watch the ABC interview:
