Bildunterschrift: Großansicht des Bildes mit der Bildunterschrift: Christian Lell (right) at a time while defending colors Bayern &quot;Two men, two women - and one big question: how well one of two men and a woman knows another man?&quot; Thus, German (excellent informed) tabloid Bild-Zeitung &quot;introduces readers to continue the story about Michael Ballack and his possible extramarital&quot; trip &quot;. Ballack is one of the two men, another man was also a professional footballer and his former teammate from Bayern - Christian Lell. A woman from this story is Daniel. Daniel is the current Lella girl. With him, expecting a child - in the sixth month of pregnancy. Ballack is, how it can be suggested between the lines of this rather bizarre story about an alleged love triangle Bundesliga, had &quot;something&quot; with Daniel. We say supposedly, because until now no one has yet confirmed Ballackovu affair with Daniel.
 Even the Lell, who for weeks &quot;feed&quot; the German media mysterious complaints on account of Ballack and colleagues about how he he &quot;interfered with private life.&quot; And we recently wrote about the &quot;scandal&quot; that hums whole of Germany, not only Bundesliga (article titled &quot;Michael Ballack - Germany&#39;s version of John Terry?&quot; Was released August 9). &quot;Not everyone like Michael Ballack and ...&quot; After Lell for multiple media confirmed that Michael Ballack was the main culprit for his private and problems at the club (a feud with Daniel, the suspension of soccer career, leaving Bayern Munich and Hertha Berlin in transition), he added that he does not want to talk in detail on this case.

I&#39;ll decide when I&#39;m about to say something&quot; and added in the same breath: &quot;Not all such as Michael Ballack to think that you can afford to enter into the private lives of other people without thinking that there are some things to destroy ... &quot; Bildunterschrift: Ballack will compete next season for his former club - Bayern Leverkusen Lell again did not say what specifically is doing.
 What Lell apparently really thinks in the new edition of the Society magazine &quot;Bunte&quot; wrote the editor in chief Patricia Riekel. She lives near Munich, her husband is very well connected with key people at Bayern, and nobody would be surprised that a journalist has information about what it was &quot;something&quot; between Ballack and Daniele. And Mrs. Riekel not choose words. Michael Ballack for her, &quot;Schuft&quot; (German word for ministers / bastard / rogue / scoundrel / rogue), Christian Lell accused of behaving like a little kid and his girlfriend, Daniel is called &quot;football grupijem. And below the question that many have asked in recent days: &quot;Is Michael Ballack was a guest at the match?&quot; In German in a figurative meaning to the description of a sex scandal. Ballack is otherwise oželnjen and has three children. Daniela, prior relationship with the Lello, a cura Bastian Schweinsteiger. Suddenly all the rubble ...

A Christian Lell allegedly told Mrs Ballack that &quot;turned to her husband.&quot; Since the Inter banned his players to publicly comment on this &quot;scandal&quot;, and you Lell silent as silence.
