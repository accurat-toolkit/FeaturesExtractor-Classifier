Imagine a material that is only one atom thick, yet supersna≈æan and good gear, and our electricity is able to reveal new secrets of fundamental physics. Such grafen, two-dimensional crystal of carbon that are isolated and Andre geim Konstantin Novoselov, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010. year. Grafen order, said the Nobel committee could have a major role in advanced electronics, such as acceleration of the computer, producing a touchscreen display, and maybe even solar cells. Andre geim Konstantin Novoselov, and scientists are of Russian descent who started his scientific career in Russia and continued in the UK. Work at manchester university where they were and 2004. when in the journal Science published their groundbreaking work on graphene. Grafen a thin layer of carbon atoms in the form of two-dimensional form of hives. In addition to being the best so far discovered transporter of electricity, grafen is the best laptop heat.
 Geim and Novoselov were first isolated it from graffiti. One millimeter of graphite containing three million graphene layers that are loose enough to hold each other that they can be separated. - I&#39;m fine, I slept well, I did not expect to get this year&#39;s Nobel prize - was the first reaction of 52-year-old professor geim, who added that he does not think because of that interrupt your usual routine and to this day and intends to implement in their research on faculty. For this year&#39;s award are connected to two curiosities - Novoselov, there are only 36 years, a geim together with Professor Michael Berry from Bristol University have won a &quot;Nobel&quot; prize - IG Nobel Prize and an American parody, which is awarded for achievement in itself contain a humorous component to experiment with levitiranjem frogs due to the strong magnetic field.
