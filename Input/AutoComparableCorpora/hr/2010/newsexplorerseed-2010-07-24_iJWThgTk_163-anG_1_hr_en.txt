North Korea has threatened powerful nuclear response to the upcoming military exercises in South Korea and the United States, calling it &quot;inexcusable&quot; provocation that comes as a climax after the wrong blaming Pyongyang for the sinking of the South Korean Cheonan Corvettes in March. The powerful National Defense Commission of North Korea, headed by Kim Jong Il, has warned that it will maintain its power to oppose military maneuvers, which include the U.S. aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered, with a &quot;holy war of vengeance,&quot; reports the American agency Associated Press. &quot;The army and people of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea legitimately be opposed to its powerful nuclear deterrence, the greatest exercises for nuclear war that has ever held the U.S. and puppet forces of South Korea,&quot; the statement said Pyongyang official news agency, which quoted an unnamed spokesman for the National Commission Defense.
 Pyongyang routinely threatens war if South Korea and the U.S. held joint military exercises, which sees North Korea as a rehearsal for an attack on its territory. United States keeps 28,500 troops in South Korea due to the deterrence of aggression, but said that does not intend to invade the North Korean peninsula. U.S. and South Korean defense ministers Robert Gates and Kim Tae-young announced earlier this week in Seoul that big four-day military exercises, which begin on Sunday, should send a &quot;clear message&quot; North Korea to stop aggressive behavior. Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang blamed for sinking corvette Cheonan South Korean waters in the western coast of the Korean Peninsula in March. Forty-six sailors died in the incident, which Seoul calls the worst attack on its troops since the Korean War 1950-53. North Korea has vigorously denied any involvement, and warned that any sanctions against it cause a war, according to Hina.
