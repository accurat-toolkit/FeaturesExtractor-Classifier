Cincinnati, 20 August 2009 Rafa Nadal and Paul-Henri Mathieu will battle this evening (after 7:00 pm local time) at the Cincinnati Masters Series tournament for a place in the quaterfinals. Mathieu, (who was knocked out big-serving Croat Ivo Karlovic in the previous round) is currently ranked 31st in the world and was never able to beat Rafa in the past 8 meetings, including 6-0 on hard courts. Despite this astonishing advantage, tonight&#39;s match Centre Court will be completely different from the previous meeting. First of all, Rafa still thinks that &quot;to improve a little more, because one week is not enough to be 100 percent.&quot; &quot;I need a little more time to adjust to the speed of the ball and to get confidence. Winning games like [yesterday] was the only way to get this trust, is not it? Well that&#39;s it. To trust and playing inside the court, I should be back on the court running before, &quot;he concluded.
