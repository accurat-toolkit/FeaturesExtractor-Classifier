 As for the Korean War, I read several times about him at Wikipedia and other sources, mainly the Internet. interesting historical event, though unfortunately the word about the war. One of the interesting things is that it is the only war in which the two were Russians and the U.S. directly confronted. much of this mighty cold war and the bark without a bite from both sides ... also, the war was highly uncertain outcomes and initiatives are unchanged drastically every few months so that you have a case where the start of the war, North Korea is coming almost to the sea in the south of the peninsula , to a situation where South Korea, with the help of USA occupies a large territory of North Korea including a complete occupation of the capital city of Pyongyang, and then again North Korea UZVRACA with the help of the Soviet Union and entered into the territory of South Korea, and then come up with any such stabilization around the 38th parallels. and so ... One more thing, I wonder is that the United States, as soaring masinerije film industry, is made more quality films about the Korean War, the more so as a war in which they certainly had the most success after WW2, and to ensure South Korea what they&#39;ve planned. .. as opposed to say vjetnamskog war where there are mountain of movies, but just a hill, and it is a war in which they withdrew and ceded the southern vjetnam north.
 And another thing: the Korean War still has not officially ended, only lasts for an agreed ceasefire signed at the conclusion of the armed conflict in July, 1953rd, except here and there by the sunken ship or fishing boat:) demosten 31.08.2010., 20:05, and another thing: Korean War still has not officially ended, only lasts for an agreed ceasefire signed at the conclusion of the armed conflict in July, 1953rd, except here and there by the sunken ship or fishing boat:) Go to google maps and there are exactly see how the definition of the line. In all countries have no idea where the boundaries of Korea but it is just seen. Roy 31.08.2010., 22:57, then again, North Korea UZVRACA with the help of the Soviet Union and entered into the territory of South Korea, and then come up with any such stabilization around the 38th parallels. and so ... In fact, the Chinese have earned 500 000 &quot;volunteers&quot; a Soviet aircraft and a number of quality airman headed to Kožedubom.

If it was not written until now it will not even write PS: see Post date: wink: I wonder 05.09.2010., 11:00 This movie is incredibly bad, pure pathos, and who had understood what would constitute a war movie should not praise this want to be hollywood garbage .. Of course the film praise. The purpose of the film is to show the tragedy of war for two brothers, drama, misery and absurdity of war. if the scene is captured as the war-so convincingly, then even better. at least there is no situation when someone gets a full burst into the belly of a four Kaplice leaking blood, or from the impact of a bullet from a gun man odskoèi 10 meters back. If we cjepidlaèit, then no movie is not showing events truthfully and accurately.
 No ga. after you make a good film only if the right people from the danger of real bullets and that it is recorded. RE Lee in 1861 05.09.2010., 13:13 am not saying that the film was shot poorly, but that was directed by a disaster. &quot;Amerikanijada&quot; made by South Korea, the man who changed sides to the fighting as I socks, and for each side swears that she will be loyal to the death, etc, etc, not to spoil anyone who has not watched the movie and there are threads on the forum it, much the same garbage such as the Pearl Harbor movie. But I say, not the place to discuss the film, I wonder 05.09.2010., 15:39 is not probable that the first attack on the guns in a joint brethren, so it has happened. is not likely to be pulled in front leytea Kurita, so it was withdrawn in full nadmoæi. is not the only such case. a thin line between adoration and hatred. a change by one of the strong messages of this film. it does not srcedrapateljne and long-term romance.
 The main thing is war and the tragedy of two brothers in it. and this is part of the executive done, at least to me. a brutal scene that shows only supplement. anyway I&#39;m not expecting a real human brain at the scene, so I did not razoèarao. lettow 24.11.2010., 12:34 Inspired by recent events opening theme of the Korean War. I do not know much about it and immediately ask one question. How is possible that in this war so quickly changed the border. It is a war that broke out just after WW2, the war in which a conquered territory lost &quot;slowly but surely.&quot; Even the Vietnam War and later the territory was not so lost and won again. But in the Korean War, northerners win almost threw the south, then nearly threw southerners north, and eventually all fit in half. To remove the border is always surprising me. In WW2 the boundary shifting slow and difficult. Here, as if it comes to some kind of medieval military conflict where one is headed by the field while nenaiðu the stronger, and then everything goes the other way.
