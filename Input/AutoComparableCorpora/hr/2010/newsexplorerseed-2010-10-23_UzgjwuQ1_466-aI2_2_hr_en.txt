Samuel Eto&#39;o has been in past season has had an important role at Inter, but the role of the first attacker with Jose Mourinho still had the Argentinian Diego Milito, scorer of important goals in the season finale in which the Italian club get hold Triple Crown. With Rafael Benitez&#39;s situation is different, because the Spanish invaders first professional role Kameruncu awarded to him by the trust Strikes - goals. In eleven previous match Eto&#39;o scored twelve of the Inter six p.m. goals, and even more interesting is the fact that the current champion won only in those matches in which the former Barcelona striker was either the archers. - Do not depend on it. When we have a complete team, then we will have alternatives, and thus we will be able to play in a different way. Either way, I think in January we will have to purchase. Only thus can we preserve the sharpness of the end of the season, &quot;said Benitez.
 While at Mourinho had to think about defense, Eto&#39;o is thrilled that the Benitez plays near the opposing door. - Play a central attacker, and as such I am completely happy. It fills me up and it is my position. I am glad that I returned to my natural position, and therefore thank coach Benitez said Eto&#39;o, a little, and then &quot;grazed&quot; Benitezovog predecessors. - We played under Mourinho and the counterattacks that very often, even when we played against weaker teams than us. Today far more strive attack, create and play, in my opinion, better. We kind of attackers is much preferred the game, added Cameron. In previous seasons, Eto&#39;o has scored regularly in English clubs, and tonight will have to dread from him and the supporters of Tottenham. - Matches against English clubs are always exciting for both players and for fans. Against the English I made a series of victories, and I hope that will continue the series against the Spurs, &quot;said Eto&#39;o, and then praised the London club players.
 - Tottenham have some sensational players like Peter Crouch, Jermain Defoe and Luka Modric and I&#39;m sure we will create many problems, but it seems to me that our opponents are afraid as soon as you arrive at the San Siro, he said Eto&#39;o.

 Clearly, the main issue is Wayne Rooney, and his potential departure from Old Trafford. Yesterday was the case in dealing with Sir Alex Ferguson told reporters. Legendary expert did not enhance the items. On the contrary. Departure Rooney after his address to the seventh power seems to be - more desirable. - We are shocked as everyone else, I do not know why he wanted to go, &quot;said United&#39;s manager, adding that the door is 24-year-striker who arrived at Old Trafford 2004th from Everton still open. - I requested a meeting with the player, but he only repeated what he said his agent, he wants to go. One of the things I said was&#39; comply with this club, &quot;I do not want to hear any nonsense. I do not know if it&#39;s done. This is disappointing because we did everything to help Wayne Rooney since he came to the club. And not only was the case with him, like they were treated and Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes ... He stressed the fact that Ferguson should clear up the situation is the fans.
 - When we played against West Brom 2:2 supporters were chanting Wayne Rooney, and this is just adding pressure on the players. I still feel that he should leave the door open, because it is a very good player. Robust attacker contract expires at season&#39;s end, but thanks to a little used, &quot;Webster&#39;s rule&quot;, the last year of the contract may be purchased for a total annual salary and compensation, that is for 5 million pounds, which is one tenth of its market value. Ironically, Rooney was United who paid 25.6 million pounds, which still makes it the most expensive player in the world up to 20 years, yesterday injured in training and will be combined for Bursaspor.
