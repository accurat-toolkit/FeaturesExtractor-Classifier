According to the SEC, the SEC has no authority &#39;to order ban&#39; broadcast any election video, say from Bandiæeva Staff. Election Headquarters Milan Bandiæa requires urgent oèitovanje of the State Election Commission regarding the ban on broadcasting the video &quot;Stop Red Croatia&quot;, because they are the legal background for the decision. &#39;According to the SEC, the SEC has the power to&#39; order the prohibition of &quot;any election broadcast video. Because in a country or a law or regulation is not regulated by the content plaæenih election ads, the SEC adopted a decision which is outside its legal powers, and not based on any law or regulation of Croatian. Thus, the SEC adopted the tentative award, which directly harms one of the candidates in the final electoral contests, &quot;the statement read. From Staff explained that the SEC&#39;s statement and the warning states that &quot;not controversial that for such a procedure there is no consensus rival &#39;, and reminds that no law or regulation of Croatian does not specify that such consent must exist.
