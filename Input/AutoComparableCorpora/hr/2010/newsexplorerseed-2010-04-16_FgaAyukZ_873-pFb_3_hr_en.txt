Before he became the Croatian President, Mr. Mesic is yelled at every mouth that the Croatian state turned into a banana republic today after being turned down from the throne of the Croatian state in the super Banana republiku.Kada Mesic 2000 years took place on the Croatian President , Croatian foreign debt to foreign countries amounted to U.S. $ 10 billion today in 2010 the Croatian foreign debt is 43 billion eura.Samo interest for odplatu external debt amounts to 3% of annual GDP a.Bilo would be nice of Mr. Mesic to explain how to waste, per capita Hrvatske.Za during his presidential period Mesic with their &quot;company&quot; certainly spent some 500 million kuna walking around for pictures and talking nonsense, and the result at the end of the economic katastrofa.Nezaposlenost is slightly below 20%. The Republic of Croatia in the first place in the world by the departure of highly educated personnel.
 In this &quot;successful,&quot; Mesic period were sold to all Croatian banks or 94%. Characteristics of the state that has its own bank, signs of Croatia from this point is not a state because it has no banke.Zasto Switzerland, Germany and America do not sell your bank? Croatian banks are treated with a Kuna 87.4 billion were sold for 5.4 billion kuna. Why are sold Croatian bank, who is the one who made the decision to sell Croatian banks based on any criteria established by the sales price of Banks. Participants of this sale Zlatko Matesa, Borislav Skegro, Marko Skreb, Franjo Lukovic, Bozidar Prka Jaksa Barbic I ask that we clarify who gave them the right and on the basis of any law committed by this type of crime, and to tell us how much property they had 1990 year and what they have now in 2010. The economy of a State can be normal and well developed only if it has its banks, if not then declines and stagnant as it is the case in hrvatskoj.Zasto commercial banks (foreign banks), the most successful business in Croatia.? What a residental policy pursued by the bank? Foreign capital banks run the government of Croatia and directs economic development in Croatia, rather than the government regulates and governs the banks can not work in Croatia.
 Let us now see how the commercial banks (foreign banks) Croatian economy destroyed and all Croatian citizens are transformed into economic slaves. According to information from the list of Vecernjog 08.05. 2009 years the banks earned 10.4 billion euros Croatian foreign debt. Foreign banks forced the import of consumer goods, it is fast and secure profits, destroying the production of domestic and external debt of Croatian citizens should pay Hrvatske.Velikodusan the CNB Governor Rohatinski to foreign banks from the reserve of 3 billion kuna gives foreign banks assets at 0.75% interest. Such cases are nowhere in the world, it exists only in Croatia. We give foreign banks cash capital for almost nothing, that we could economically destroy themselves put a rope around his neck and then we&#39;ll say, well, we did not mean that we will slip below the chair nogu.Poslovne banks (foreign banks) are a source of corruption in Croatia . In these banks are in prominent places Croatian Janicari paid ten times higher than salaries in Croatian, but they are ready at any moment to cut down the Croatian &quot;head&quot;.
 Nonetheless, &quot;Janicari&quot; know very well that when I move the move, it would not be accidentally changed the super privileged position of banks or not to set up Croatia Bank. So-called state companies doing business through foreign banks and lo and behold, the state guarantees them business. Why does this situation exist? All persons who made important and significant decisions are corrupt. Where you are academically educated Croatian citizens, do not you see that you have become economic slaves?. &quot;No one is free who is not your master. In Croatia, the bank manages. Sometimes slaves were tied with chains, but today I Ivo Josipovic Kosor are humane and related Croatian citizens in Europe only by law required to pay the debt of Europe regularly, and be good consumers of the goods of poor quality, which is exported to Western Europe, Croatia and Eastern Europe. Unfortunately we Croats have always been a colony, and &quot;cultural&quot; of Europe and now we have become the same, we have always been &quot;colony&quot; of Europe.

General Rojs who was the first day on the bus to Plitvice Lakes to the storm to the top of the Knin fortress Yugoslav scum chased his kingdom is completed in the state of Croatia. The one thin thread that you want to say is closer to Mesic&#39;s interpretation that the general&#39;s players turned into a partisan revolutionaries who enjoys folk hero fame Bosko Buha in kozaraèkom round. In my opinion, for example, would not have played Pašaliæ Žikino round, while the example Èaèiæ game and presented as part of Croatian culture and heritage.
