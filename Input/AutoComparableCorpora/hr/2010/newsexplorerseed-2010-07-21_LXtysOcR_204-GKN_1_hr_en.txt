The legendary West German disco group &quot;Boney M&quot;, which is a producer Franz Reuther, who was called Frank Farian, gathered from the hired singers from the Caribbean (two from Jamaica, one in Montserrat and one from Aruba), and day older and one younger, remember the numerous hits from the seventies is the beginning of the eighties: &quot;Daddy Cool&quot;, &quot;Ma Baker&quot;, &quot;Hooray! Hooray! It&#39;s a Holi-Holiday&quot;, &quot;Rasputin&quot; ... One of the singer Maizie Williams, now performs under the name &quot;Boney M&quot;, as the only members of the group to the authorization of the founders and owners of the names of Frank Fariana. Under this name in Wednesday night occurred at a music festival in Palestine, in the Palace of Culture in Ramallah in the West Bank, but with a ban. Maizie sang the hits &quot;Daddy Cool&quot;, &quot;Ma Baker&quot; and &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot;, but at the request of the organizer is omitted from the program one of the biggest chart hits, hit processing reggae group The Melodians &quot;of the late sixties,&quot; Rivers of Babylon. &quot;
 Specifically, the &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; in the chorus directly quoted the Book of Psalms (Psalm 137 and 19:14) in which we talk about the longing of the Jews expelled to their home, Israel. As part of the Palestinian political doctrine that denies the right of Jews to return to Israel, the festival organizers felt that the song &quot;unseemly&quot; and asked that it be omitted. - It&#39;s some kind of political thing or something, but they asked us not to play and we were somewhat disappointed - said Maizie Williams.
