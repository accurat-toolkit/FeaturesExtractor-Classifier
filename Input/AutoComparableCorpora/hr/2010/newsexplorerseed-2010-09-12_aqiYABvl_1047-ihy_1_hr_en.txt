IIstražujući the archives of Zagreb, Karlovac, Zadar, Dubrovnik, Belgrade, Vienna, Budapest, Prague, Moscow, St. Petersburg and Istanbul, I came to the authentic documents which cast a completely different light, as the events related to Mehmed Pasha and his brilliant political and statesman career, and his undoubtedly great statesman and political influence both within the Ottoman Empire, and the world. Certainly can not ignore that this influence through indirect or direct broadcast into Bosnia. As a senior, then the highest imperial dignity, under the Grand Vizier of Sultan Suleyman the three El - Kanunije, Selim II and Murat, the third was a direct actor in the most important world events of that time, it affected them, and often brought a final decision. Adhering to the historical sources, and consciously avoiding any form of mitoligizaranja, I have tried to present it at the time and circumstances in which he lived and worked.
 Perhaps nowhere else in the Ottoman dignitary was not to the extent of adherence to Islam as expressed in the case of Mehmed-pasha. I emphasize this because the historiography and literature had occasion frequently to experience polulaži, lies, forgeries and malicious distortion of facts which did not want to humiliate only Mehmed Pasha, the importance of the powerful Ottoman Empire in the preservation of Bosnia, but also Islam as a permanent and universal category universal history of civilization. I mean, it&#39;s time to get it corrected and I have tried, within its capabilities to do in this novel and I do. In addition to Mehmed Pasha, but three spomenutuih Sultan, the novel appears in a series of real historical figures, which along with personal observations imagitativno-literary in the novel is actually trying to present an entirely different picture than usual, whether it be on the Mehmed-Pasha&#39;s military campaigns, statesman decisions or building and its Waqf endowment (in Bosnia: Mosque, imaret and plumbing in the home village Sokolovići, Visegrad Bridge, the bridge on Zepa, the bridge Trebišnjici, Goat Bridge), not to mention (which I mostly describe) the construction of a number of waqf and an endowment in Istanbul, Brusa, Horses, Edrenu, Buda, Pest, Sigetu, Belgrade, paddock, Erzuramu, Cairo, Baghdad and elsewhere), which is less known or knowingly concealed.
 Documents indicate a conspiracy in which he brutally murdered, but not at the hands of dervishes hamzevijskog order, according to the official historiography and South Slavic literature, but an assassination attempt a complex and fully amnesty hamzevije, where centuries anathema to his death. Of course, I brought all this into a novel, adhering to the truth and historical documents. SPECIFICATIONS: Items: volume I-II covers, hard, plastic-coated, matte.
