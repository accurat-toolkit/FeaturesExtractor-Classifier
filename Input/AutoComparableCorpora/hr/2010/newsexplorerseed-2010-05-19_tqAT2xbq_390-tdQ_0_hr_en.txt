The famous linguist and philosopher, known as a sharp critic of Israeli policies, an American Jew, Noam Chomsky, which was on Sunday banned from entering Israel, said that such a decision due to the fact that he intended only to give a lecture on Palestinian, not Israeli, and the university. - It&#39;s hard to remember a similar case in which a person is denied entry because they do not teach in Tel Aviv. Perhaps only in the Stalinist regime - Chomsky said in a telephone interview from Amman to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Chomsky (81) tried to enter Israel from Jordan in order to give a lecture at the University of Bir Zeit near Ramallah in the West Bank, Hebron and visits to meet with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayad. Palestinian representative Mustafa Barghouti, who was supposed to be the host professor, told Reuters that the decision of Israel&#39;s &quot;fascist actions bordering on suppression of freedom of expression&quot;.
 A spokeswoman for the Israeli Ministry of Interior Sabine Hadad said she was still trying to clarify things with the army, nagovijestiv≈°i possibility that Chomsky is still allowed to enter. Chomsky has previously often spoke out against the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.
