In the second set, Dodi was a lot harder to service, going without dealing with the break-ball, to wait for his chance with the leadership of 6:5. The first break in the match was made at the right time, ensuring alignment at 1-1 in sets. In the third section Querrey has turned things in his favor break for 2-1 and took the set for the end of the service by Ivanov trailing 5:3. Given that in this set played quite lukewarm, then things did not look the best for the 25-year MeÄ‘ugorca, but fortunately, by the end of the match, the impression was much better - Dodig shades were missing for entry into the fifth set.
 Before today the only tie-break, the fourth section has gone without a break-balls on either side, and all the excitement that they had failed compensated in game decisions. Querrey is the early mini-break to lead 4-1, Ivan is back in the finals had four unrelated set-balls, at 7:6 with the service, and the chance it was also the best - Croatian ace in the hole was attacked after the service and played a solid backhand-volley, but not the best cover system, which is punished Querrey forehand pass-parallel. After the missed opportunity to enter the fifth Dodigov end was not in style. On the match-ball in behind the 11:10 he helped American double fault, ending worries 18th carrier, which is in tie-break a lot of things got service. But as soon as we started to change, Querrey has not worked so hard - a good part of this match will certainly not be pleased.
