Award comes my review:) The first appearance ... Like a red mask and the weight of that facility. Tipkica might be a little easier to hit, like I have to drive the reality, but not a big disadvantage. Also, the screen is very easy to get scratched, so it is recommended that this gadget you carry in a holster. Storage capacity, I have no objection, 4GB is more than enough to enjoy the music crowd, and even in movies or episodes of your favorite series! And if some of it boring, you can switch on the radio! It has the ability to record sound, but I have not tried it yet. Battery life is also no objection, holding long enough and can easily be charged (via a cable that connects to your computer). Menu and controls are simple and easy to understand even without instructions. Picture and audio quality is very good, but headphones are not suitable for my ears, too wide ... I&#39;ll have to change them. Only major drawback that I experienced was that I could not figure out that a very long video format supported by this MP4 ...
 Until I tried some 10-odd codec and bitrate this, I realized that supporting this format: With the program Any Video Converter settings set up right, Profile. Wmv, down options: WMV V9, format 320x240, bitrate 192, A / V Sync Basic! Okay, so maybe some help! UGL. This was his only major flaw, everything else is great! Rating -5!
