From Japan via Hamburg to Amsterdam: the ways in which global capital transformed its red-light fourth By Barbara Matejčić Sex tourism is a very lucrative industry that is still there since the sixties of the wider world. It is estimated that the sex tourism draws from two to as much as 14 percent of gross domestic product in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. Besides these countries, the most popular sex tourism destinations are Brazil, Cuba, Sri Lanka, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and Kenya. In developed countries, sex tourism takes place in more or less regulated conditions, the popular red-light districts, such as the famous one in Amsterdam. Although the red light district greatly contributed to the reputation of Amsterdam as well-known European destinations, the Dutch it is increasingly limited, trying to change the dominant image of the city legaliziranih soft drugs and prostitution. In that key can read the latest news that the Dutch government plans to raise the minimum age limit for prostitutes from 18 to 21 years.
 Justice is to protect the prostitutes themselves - a person with 21 years of age can better judge about whether they want to engage in prostitution, according to an official statement - although such&#39;s decision in accordance with the measures which for years trying all the more difficult conditions for prostitutes&#39;&#39; work&#39;&#39;in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam&#39;s red-light fourth Wallen (&#39;&#39;walls&#39;&#39;was named after the medieval walls) with sex shops, the Museum of Sex, peep šouove and a stage on which to live can watch sex porn actors today is about three hundred windows where &#39;&#39;exposed&#39;&#39;prostitutes. Every year it is less, is a big blow to the business was two years ago when the city administration decided to close the window even fifty. The official explanation was that the fight against crime, particularly trafficking and pimping. Specifically, in the Netherlands is legalized prostitution, but prostitutes should do for themselves, they must be nationals of some EU member states and should not be a prostitute on the street.
 But Mariska Majoor, head Prostitucijskog information center and an activist for the rights of sex workers claimed that reducing the number of windows will reduce the crime rate, but they will only raise your rent ..
 Instead of prostitution which attracts tourists, authorities in promoting Redlight Fashion Amsterdam last year, the city administration continued to clean the fourth closing the famous theater which performed live sex Casa Rosso and the Banana strip club bar. That are determined to change the image of Amsterdam, which made him famous, confirmed by the fact that the city bought two dozen 17-centuries-old buildings in which they were prostitutes and rented them to fashion designers, bookshops, galleries and other&#39;&#39;decent&#39;&#39;activities. Launched the slogan Redlight Fashion, Design and Redlight Redlight Art that tries to compete unambiguous connotation of red lights. The current city plans the closure of even half of the red window, but also reduce the sex clubs and cafes where the drug sales easy. City authorities claim they do not want to throw sex workers, but only reduce crime, which has branched out around the sex industry and offer an alternative for tourists in this picturesque neighborhood.
 But, apparently, will not take long to be rare after prostitutes red light illuminated windows in the neighborhood where for centuries the bread earners. A similar process is undergone by many quarters of the world capitals that have been known for prostitution, pornography, immigration and life in general&#39;&#39;on the edge of society&#39;&#39;. So the French writer Jean Genet hardly recognized the Barcelona El Raval district of which he wrote in &#39;Diary of thieves&#39; middle of the last century. Once the biggest red-light district in Europe, El Raval (which in turn means an area outside the walls) has undergone a very aggressive transformation in the past decade. There is not only undesirable tenants move out, but the entire building ended up under the bulldozers to make way for parks, plazas, museums and hotels. There is a built Museum of Contemporary Art, there is a Camper edited his yuppie hotel, there are open trend-setting shops, the schools are located and moved by students.
 In El Raval process has not fully done, still has the seal of an immigrant neighborhood and is still on its edges together street prostitutes and dodgy types so that the atmosphere can be unpleasant as that in the rare large European city. There would still Genet fare, but it will not for long ..
 Once the biggest red-light district in Europe, the Barcelona El Raval has undergone a very aggressive transformation in the past decade in the same period in El Raval, changes are caught and London&#39;s Kings Cross. In the Eighties it was known as London&#39;s red-light district, a place where tourists are advised not go down because of drug dealers, street prostitution and pickpockets. After the great purges of the nineties is now exactly where many tourists stay. First, in the eighties due to the low rents and good positions within the city moved there young artists and designers, and then in the next decade, the government decided to seriously deal with Kings Cross. The biggest project there is a new railway station, which is the huge funds invested on a large bell announced that the fourth transformation is carried out and attract new tenants. Soon they began to open cultural institutions such as the new British Library building and the Symphony Orchestra, and for them, followed by private capital - built two thousand apartments, five million square feet of office space, hotels and headquarters of large companies (including The Guardian and The Observer), but also the seat of the police department for combating drugs.
 This is the only link with what is Kings Cross used to be. Paris is just the way Barcelona and London. Despite the Catholic name, street Saint-Denis in the heart of the city known for its sex shops, porn theaters and prostitution. While once almost exclusively about sex came to Saint-Denis, now in parallel with the men who elected companion for half an hour can see couples who are buying organically grown vegetables in expensive stores with healthy food. Street began to change a few years ago when the city administration decided to stop the monopoly of the sex industry and established the company is majority owned by the city. The company buys unused space in the street, restored it and rented to small businesses and trades, depending on what activity is required in this part of town. Although claiming that their goal is not to dislodge the sex trade, but also improve the living conditions of inhabitants of Saint-Denis did not have to travel half a mile to buy a decent baguette, it is more likely that the first part of the scenario does happen.
 If they do, and was not an obvious target as in London, it&#39;s a logical sequence of events. When Saint-Denis becomes a comfortable bourgeois life, the people no longer want to see prostitutes on the street or glossy advertisements for pornographic films. Although prostitution is legalized in Germany 2,001th year, many city governments to make it not happen. Thus, in Hamburg. Hours of the night in a maze of streets in the St. Pauli red-light fourth once were very lively and today the economy is based on the sex experiencing difficult days, and that a global recession that is not the main culprit. Eighties, there were gathered more than a thousand prostitutes. Many of them have worked in the famous brothel Eros that stretched across six floors and the door was closed ten years ago. Last year, the deal gave the Luxor hotel, the last in the brothel district, known for its neon signs that have been promised &#39;nice girls for happy nights. &quot;
 Today it is estimated that another 400 remained persistent sex workers in St Paul. While some will blame it for the popularity of pornography on the Internet and that in Hamburg no longer come sailors lust after months of abstinence from sex, have played their role and entrepreneurs who want to make a safe neighborhood for residential and commercial buildings ..
 Of the thousands of prostitutes in Hamburg St Pauli them today for 400 sex industry in Japan includes quite a few different offers from European ones: dirty panties teens that are sold in vending machines, sushi, which is in the high-end restaurants serving the maiden naked bodies in manga that is not explicitly allowed view of sexual relations, but because the great general with falusoidnim beings like an octopus, a fascination Bukkake (sexual practice in which several men ejaculate on the woman&#39;s face or the seed collected in jugs so drunk) and so on. On the other hand, the popular hostess&#39;&#39;clubs&#39;&#39;are very modest: there are drink expensive beverages to flert with someone who has paid for it. The main entertainment comes down to the faking of seduction, and the clientele is equally male and female. The city authorities decided Kabukicho, Tokyo red-light district which is called&#39;&#39;the city&#39;&#39;that does not sleep, so limit what they referred to the old law and forbade the work of these clubs after the one in the night.
 In Kabukichou is located about three thousand night clubs, discos,&#39;&#39;love hotels&#39;&#39;where rooms rented by the half hour, and hostess clubs. As their profits are reduced, so the sex workers crossed the street. They developed a lucrative business for the individual tourist tours through the city, where girls dressed as a male butler water town guests holding them by the hand ..
 Tokyo conducts the largest purge of the city&#39;s red-light district Kabukicho Kabukichou main problem is not sexual in nature, but the mafia. There are, however, brings together well-known Japanese yakuza mafia and its Chinese counterpart to the mafia triad. District authorities are able partially cleared from the Chinese mafia carrying out frequent raids of immigrant office. In the district to strengthen the police presence, placed the number of cameras for video surveillance and closed down the illegal clubs and brothels. Complete the operation was being conducted last couple of years ago titled&#39;&#39;Renaissance&#39;&#39;Kabukichoa. From Bangkok, but will tend to go. There is sex tourism is one of the major industries and many benefit from it. True, the former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra tried to make something work limiting teams to two hours after midnight, but the work still goes the old routine. In Bangkok it is difficult to talk about a red-light district, because the whole town shared a well-organized store with the concept - something for everyone.
 It is most famous Patpong, the hordes of tourists who come to see the famous ping-pong&#39;&#39;performance&#39;&#39;(for those who still do not know what it is: women show how they developed vaginal muscles so that vaginal throw various items, including and pin-pong balls, or arrows, also from the vagina, shooting at the balloons, goldfish back to the aquarium and so bizarre), and the crowd ladyboy (men who so far look like a woman that even in modest bikinis can not detect). Americans and Europeans who want more action go to Nana Plaza, which is said to be the biggest complex of&#39;&#39;sex&#39;&#39;in the world, wealthy Thais and Japanese venture into a cocktail bar at street Ratchadapisek, while Silom Soi 2 bankoški gay epicenter. Well informed and say that in some luxurious hotels you can choose with whom to spend the night, and shall be elected from the local fashion magazine - the cover girl could be your friend the night.
 Bangkok is not so soon undergo a transformation in London, Hamburg and Barcelona type. Sex trafficking is too wide and makes too much money to almost anyone not in their interest to abolish the safe flow of cash ..
 Bangkok does not deny sex industry because it brings too much money went to The Australian story is somewhat different order from the European practice of cleaning troubled neighborhoods. In Sydney, the red-light district called the same as in London - Kings Cross - but it was originally inhabited by the urban hipster. In the thirties of last century there were living artists, writers, actors, and later hippies and soldiers who were recovering after the Vietnam War. It was just idyllic settlement in the middle class, but to live quite comfortably and without incident. Then the nineties began to open illegal gambling, strip clubs and watched them prostitutes, drug dealers and various criminals. Neighborhood was no longer so benign and early new millennium, once again began to change. This time, the state order. The authorities have invested 15 million U.S. dollars in&#39;&#39;facelift&#39;&#39;, regulate the sex industry and increase police patrols.
 She closed the trouble spots, and have opened up new&#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39;centers. When housing prices gone up enormously, the old inhabitants were forced to leave. Although the Kings Cross can still be found&#39;&#39;adult&#39;&#39;bookstore, a waitress who served in topless and some strip bar, it is only a pale reminder of what it once was. While some approve of the changes, others complain that Sydney ever lost a part of their identity. So it&#39;s always clean up red-light neighborhoods: lose color and a portion of memory, but fix the focus problem and get a new place for an expensive square meter. The ratio of lost and gained a very clear and pure&#39;&#39;profit&#39;&#39;is the one who wins&#39;&#39;dirty business&#39;&#39;. (Business daily) Posted: 26 April 2010 8:39
