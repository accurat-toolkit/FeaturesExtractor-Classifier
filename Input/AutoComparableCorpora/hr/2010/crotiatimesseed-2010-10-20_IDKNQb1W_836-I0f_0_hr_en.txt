 Film &quot;Pljaèkaš&quot; - won the Golden Pram for best feature film (in front of the cinema Europa) Posted at 01:25 PM • Comments (0) • Print • # Friday, 15.10.2010. Guns N &#39;Roses @ Arena Zagreb Do you know where you are? You&#39;re in the jungle baby. Wake up, time to die! Ok, we will not literally greeting frontman of one of the greatest rock band of all time, but the audience is already the first bars of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was in a trance. At Friday, 09/24 Guns N &#39;Roses Arena in Zagreb for the first time participated in this fair land. Some will say that they came with twenty years of delay, but nakodnadili for such a long absence nearly three-hour gig. The band was delayed half an hour, which is more than acceptable considering that&#39;s general known that Axl Rose will not leave the stage before midnight. The hall was filled almost to the last place, bringing the fans showed they are still looking for a good portion of rock n &#39;roll.
 Guns have come in the new set at the head of the Axl Rose-om, a man who has spent the last fifteen years in the studio snimajuæi latest album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. Although he was joined on stage are not big names such as Slash and Duff McKagan of Guns N &#39;Roses original lineup, the concert was actually worked flawlessly, so that we can at times be able to ask: &quot;Oh, that Slash?&quot;. Fireworks and sprinklers start a concert songs from the new album and continued to line up the old hits like &quot;Welcome to the Jungle,&quot; &quot;Mr. Browntone,&quot; You Could Be Mine, &quot;&quot; November Rain &quot;and many others. Axl in his distinctive style Between songs mjenjao&#39;s outfits, shiny jackets, torn jeans, a red scarf on his head and showed a naked torso. His vocal abilities all the while raising the atmosphere in the hall, showing that there are still &quot;something&quot; which makes it one of the most talented rock glazenika in history.
 The new setup is more than impressive. Almost all the band members are trained musicians who play several instruments. The latest addition to the band came in the form of guitarist DJ Ashba-e, who took over the role it once had Slash. After the concert, many have complained they have not heard Axl&#39;s singing cult song &quot;Do not cry, not knowing that on that song at live shows no sing of 94 &#39;in memory of the early deceased friend and frontman of the group&quot; Blind Melon &quot; -Shannon Hoon-a, or else the great Axl&#39;s friend and back vowels in the aforementioned song. This, I can freely say, the spectacle, ended bisom where they played &quot;Paradise City,&quot; &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; - processing of AC / DC, Patience and Madagascar. Guys showed that the great professionals that we can still burn your old and new hits. Setlist: 1 Chinese Democracy 2nd Welcome To The Jungle third It&#39;s So Easy 4th Mr. Brownstone 5th
