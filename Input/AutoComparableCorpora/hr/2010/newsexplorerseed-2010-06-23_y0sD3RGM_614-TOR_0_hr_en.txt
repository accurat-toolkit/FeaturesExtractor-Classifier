24SI - The federal judge in New Orleans, in Louisiana, on Tuesday blocked the six-month moratorium on oil exploration drilling in deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, at the White House announced an appeal. District Judge Martin Feldman handed down a preliminary ban moratorium, which stopped work on all wells at depths greater than 500 meters and stopped issuing new permits for drilling. President Barack Obama introduced the moratorium after an explosion on an oil rig Deepwater Horizon, off the coast of Louisiana 20th April. The blast killed 11 workers, and later sinking of the platform has led to damage to subsea installations on the well and caused the largest oil stain in the history of the United States. Justice Department lawyer Brian Collins, said Monday that a moratorium is needed, while officials checked the security on the wells. The group of companies providing boats and equipment for the petroleum industry in the Gulf of Mexico, filed a complaint against the Obama administration, arguing that the government has no evidence that existing operations threaten the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and asks the court to declare the moratorium invalid and unenforceable.
 Judge Feldman was declared &quot;null and void the decision of the agency to prohibit drilling at a depth of over 500 meters, giving the explanation that she&quot; can not justify an immeasurable impact on prosecutors, the local economy, the Gulf region, and today a key aspect of the availability of domestic energy in the U.S. in &quot;. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said that the government would immediately appeal the decision to a federal appellate court. Steve Newman, CEO of the company Transocean, which is performed on the BP-drilling rig Deepwater Horizon this, said on Tuesday that he supported ending the moratorium, a moratorium blocking the support given by the Republican governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal, though the worst oil slick contaminated coastal areas and state.
