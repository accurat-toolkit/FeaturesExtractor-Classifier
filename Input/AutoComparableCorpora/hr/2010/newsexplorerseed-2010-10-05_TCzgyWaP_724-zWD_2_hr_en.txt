The prize of 10 million kronor (1.1 million) - and climb to the very scientific Olympus this year won the Andre geim and Konstantin Novoselov. They are originally from Russia, but geim is a Dutch citizen, and Novoselov, besides Russian, and has British citizenship. Joint working at the University of Manchester and in particular they are interested in the properties of carbon. However, their carbon is no longer any coal or diamond, but the so-called grafen - a new form of carbon is very distinctive properties. He not only is the thinnest and strongest material known, but it is virtually transparent and exceptional conductor of electricity. Actually, the thinner can not be - it is practically &quot;obese&quot; is just one atom. Scientists have come up to him very simply, just as each of us writes in pencil which is also carbon. But these scientists carbon layer is much thinner than on paper. &quot;It opens opportunities inconceivable&quot; Bildunterschrift: Gro√üansicht des Bildes mit der Bildunterschrift: And the diamond is carbon, like coal.
 Grafen that the new form of carbon and extraordinary properties. On the other hand shows and distinctive properties in electronics. Since this is a practical two-dimensional world, it opens many possibilities in quantum physics. But not only there - but in consumer electronics worldwide. Grafen creates the possibility for the production of new touch screens, light panels, and maybe he will just be a means where the solar cell to achieve incredible performance for now. It is also the explanation of Committee for the Nobel Peace Prize: the discovery raises the possibility of &quot;a vast variety of new practical possibilities, creating new materials and manufacturing of advanced electronics.&quot; For example, the transistors from graphene would be incomparably faster than today&#39;s, silicone which will then open up the possibility of computers and what they can still be just another dream.
