There is also the construction of sugar, as directed by an Austrian company. The start of production in &quot;Bimal&quot; invested over 10 million euros.

Bad privatization drove out onto the street and the workers catering company &quot;Sava&quot; commercial enterprise &quot;Potkozarje.

Then, the limestone mine and lime factory, which took over the Belgian company &quot;karmus group&quot; and &quot;Integral Engineering&quot; from Laktasi.
