Shimon Peres after we attempt to curry favor by saying that &quot;Tito the force introduced the Croats in Yugoslavia,&quot; Shimon Peres is, reports the &quot;Morning&quot;, the Esplanade encountered the &quot;Croatian intellectuals.&quot; As for me, this meeting did not represent anyone, here&#39;s my written contributions. Croatia&#39;s policy towards the conflict in the Middle East is extremely unbalanced in favor of Israel. Many Croats, not only in exile, could really be captivated by Israel after the UN-sponsored a 1948th on the part of Palestine declared an independent state, there was a war that the Arabs lost. Defending himself against threats that will be thrown into the sea, Israel&#39;s wars of &#39;56., &#39;67., &#39;70., &#39;73. / 4 and &#39;82., significantly expanded the territory and came into position to return part of the conquered areas of extorting a confession from his neighbors (&quot;land for peace&quot;). The metaphor of the struggle for survival of the monk Begin who went from terrorist to Nobel Prize winner for peace.
 But in the idealized condensed picture does not see how Israel is isolated: not respect the will of the UN nor the demands of the Allies, has an unknown quantity of nuclear weapons, legalized the collective reprisals against the families of militants, the Wall of shame was sealed apartheid. In a word, do not give up jihad. Is it surprising that in some studies 59 percent of Europeans consider Israel a larger threat to peace than Iran? But Shimon Peres, who was Israel&#39;s policy of responsible government twice, and as president, and as a Nobel Laureate for Peace, due to several victims of Israeli retaliation zealously defend against thousands of Palestinians ... our Uncritical support for Israel will not help, and Croatia shame. duško Čizmić Marovic
