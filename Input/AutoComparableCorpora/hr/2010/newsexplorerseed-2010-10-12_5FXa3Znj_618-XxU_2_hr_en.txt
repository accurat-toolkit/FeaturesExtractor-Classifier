Palestinians celebrated the 10,000-the anniversary of the founding of the city of Jericho, an oasis in the West Bank, which is considered one of the oldest and perhaps the oldest city in the world. The team met on the occasion of the Palestinian Council of Ministers, the government organized the celebration along with military fanfare and fireworks. &quot;It&#39;s not only about the celebration of the anniversary, but also preparing to establish a Palestinian state within the national project,&quot; said Prime Minister Salam Fajad. Residents complain that the celebration of Jericho, which was originally supposed to be organized on the occasion of the inauguration of several major projects, was not held as it was devised with regard to the planned projects are completed on time. Local agents responsible for this situation are considered Israeli restrictions and international donors who have not submitted the necessary assistance to the projects implemented. One of them is a water treatment plant worth 50 million U.S. dollars.
 Jericho is considered one of the oldest cities in the world, and on this evidence remains of settlements from the 9000-BC and remains of fortifications built in 7000 BC, which means that they are 4000 years older than the Egyptian pyramids. The city is the second most visited destination in the West Bank after Bethlehem. (Hin / metro-portal)
