Prof. Dr. Ivan Dikic did not pass the corresponding member of Academy-a! Of the ten votes required in the Department of Medical Science Professor. Dikic received only seven votes. In this story, however, interesting as our eminent scientists of the Academy members were asked to accept the nomination for the corresponding member. Dikic - as we said last night - accepted nomination because he wanted to help in the realization of some scientific projects and programs within the Academy and for which he also was asked. - I&#39;m not familiar with the details, but as far as I know 12 members of the Department of Medical Sciences stood behind my nomination. But what happened that I finally got only seven votes, I really can not - said prof. Dikic whom we met at a congress in Jerusalem. But, he says, is not disappointed, nor think that happened some scandal or affair. - I have no need to enter the Academy, and as such I have too much work and projects.
 And if the Academy, and some people in the Academy-to think that I do not deserve and did not want me, and I repeat after me called themselves, actually feel a certain relief - said prof. Dikic.
