Ireland has published a variety of bowed and unpopular austerity measures that should help bring the country back on track. In addition to cutting costs and raising taxes, one of nepopularnijih measures is to reduce the minimum wage, the new property taxes and big layoffs in the public sector. The four-year plan designed to save the country 15 billion euros, or $ 20 billion. In addition, the Government is still negotiating a package of lifesaving European Union and the International Monetary Fund that should be worth around 85 billion euros. The Recovery Plan provides for reduction of 24,750 jobs in the public sector, social welfare savings of 2.8 billion euros and 1.9 billion higher revenues from income tax. The Government will reduce the minimum salary for one euro, to 7.65 euros per hour. VAT will increase from 21 percent to 22 percent in 2013. year, with that in 2014. be even greater, or 24 percent. However, Ireland will continue to maintain a low corporate tax, and to 12.5, although many suggested that the revenue collected fastest increase if the tax is exactly that.
 Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said the government will soon introduce a tax on property, most of which will cost homeowners up to 200 euros by 2014. year. In addition, he said, savings and cuts will be focused on areas of greatest cost - salaries, pensions and social benefits. Total to austerity measures needed to save 10 billion euros, a tax increase in the future should bring income and savings of five billion euros. Prime Minister Brian Cowen said he hoped the plan will bring security to people and hope for a better future. - We can and we will draw from this crisis as we have already done in the past. We love this country and we want our children to have a future - he said. Despite the measures for the salvation of Ireland, S &amp; P lowered the rating of the Irish for one category, with the AA to AA-. Of course, the reason is concern about the costs of rescuing the financial sector.
