Recently in Gaza were shot down numerous Guinness World Records in order to draw attention to the predicament of the Palestinian people. These records are joined by another resident, who has made the greatest Ramadan lantern in the world. Light high 10 and 3.5 meters wide was made of wood and fabrics inspired by lamps that illuminate the streets across the Muslim world during the holy month. I am determined to set a world record and send a message to the world to end blockade of Gaza, said 24-year-old Mustafa Massoud who spent about 300 euros for materials needed for construction. Massoud is hoping that the message will get to rival governments in Gaza and the West Bank and will fail to bridge differences. Otherwise, this is the third attempt in a series of breaking world records, after the UN agency for Palestinian refugees set a record for the most number of children who juggle basketballs and most flying kites.
 And the two previous events have had a goal to attract international attention to the position of Palestinians in Gaza, which is located under the four-Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Israel reduced the restrictions after the international scandal that caused the attack on the humanitarian ships and allowed the entry of basic foodstuffs. However, Israel still strictly controls the movement of people into and out of Gaza, which has since June 2007. under the control of Hamas.
