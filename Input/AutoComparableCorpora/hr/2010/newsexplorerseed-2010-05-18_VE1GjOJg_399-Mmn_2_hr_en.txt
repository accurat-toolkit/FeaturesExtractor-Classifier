Noam Chomsky, the world&#39;s leading leftist thinker, describing Israel as a paranoid country, &quot;similar to South Africa in the sixties, when she realized that (because of apartheid) has become a pariah state and began to act similarly.&quot; Chomsky&#39;s review said in an interview for the London Times (Times), regarding the decision of the Israeli authorities that he would not permit entry to the occupied Palestinian territory of the West Bank, where he was asked to give a lecture at Bir Zeit University in Ramallah. &quot;Apparently they did not like what I wanted to give a lecture at the Palestinian university, not in Israel,&quot; says Chomsky, whom The Times describes as a critic of Israel and U.S. policy that speaks his mind. Although the Israeli authorities described the whole incident as a misunderstanding, Chomsky says that the boundary was investigated for three hours by officers at all times been in contact with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. &quot;I do not know of other examples, outside of totalitarian states, where people are forbidden to enter because they want to give a lecture,&quot; said Chomsky.
 The London daily said that the ban Chomsky on the West Bank sparked angry reactions among Palestinians, but also in Israel, where one of the most popular dailies in the commentary noted that the whole incident is an attempt at suppression of freedom of the country and opening the door to fascism. Chomsky was born in 1928th in Philadelphia of Jewish parents, immigrants from Eastern Europe.
