Eruption Eyjafjallajökull 2010th refers to a series of significant volcanic activity Eyjafjallajökulla in southern Iceland in 2010. It was the first eruption of the volcano after almost 200 years. Seismic activity began as early as end of 2009. and led to volcanic eruptions 20th March 2010. [1] The second eruption began on 14 April 2010. and led to the biggest disruption of air traffic in the history of Europe caused by a natural disaster. Millions of passengers remained stuck at the airports of 15 April. Contents [edit] The eruption of Icelanders are recorded eruption Eyjafjallajokull 920th, 1612th 1821st and 1823rd, where it is often observed phenomenon that occurred after the eruption of the neighboring, larger volcano, Katla. [2] The Icelandic Meteorological Office reported in 2009. to increased seismic activity in Eyjafjallajökulla around since 2006. until 2009. when he recorded 250 small earthquakes.
 [3] Passersby watch Fimmvorduhals smoke at the end of 2009, it happened a thousand smaller earthquakes (mostly of magnitude 1-2), about 7-10 kilometers beneath the volcano. [4] 26 February 2010 GPS equipment used by the Meteorological Institute of Iceland at the farm in the area Þorvaldseyri Eyjafjölla (approximately 15 km south of the location of the recent eruption [5]) showed local displacement of the earth&#39;s crust 3 inches to the south, from which the displacement of 1 cm occurred in the period of four days. It served as evidence that the magma flowing under the crust into a chamber with a Eyjafjallajökulla that the pressure caused a shift in Earth&#39;s crust at the farm Þorvaldseyri. [6] Since the third to 5 March, about 3,000 earthquakes were measured at the epicenter of the volcano, although most were imperceptible strength. [7] It is believed that the eruption commenced on 20 March 2010., between 22:30 and 23:30 local time. [8] [9] &quot;Disaster Tourism&quot; is a lightning fast spread around the volcano after the eruption when the travel agent offered to people traveling to watch the eruption. [10] Icelandic company telekominikacijska Mila [11] was set up three cameras that broadcast images eruption with Valahnúkura , and Hvolsvöllur Þórólfsfella. [12] [edit] Evacuation of about 500 farmers and their families have been evacuated from the area Fljótshlíð, Eyjafjöll and Landeyjar overnight with the 20th
 to 21 March, and in Reykjavík flights were canceled because of volcanic ash, but the late 21st March, domestic and international flights were re-released into circulation. [13] [14] [15] Residents risky zone areas Fljótshlíð, Eyjafjöll Landeyjar and was allowed to return to their farms after a meeting of the Department of Public Protection 22nd March and the evacuation plan has been temporarily suspended. 29th March police have reopened all roads to the volcano. However, after the second eruption, the road was closed again because of the danger of flooding due to volcanic heat the end of the nearby glaciers and other snow reservoirs, but the road was re-opened on 1 April. [16] [17] [18] [edit] Second crack cracks, observed in the north, 2 April 2010. The crack is 500 meters long and has a 10-12 eruptirajućih lava craters whose temperature is about 1.000 ° C. [19] The eruption is characterized as relatively dangerous, with the typical characteristics of the flow of lava from the volcano. [20] Liquid lava was flowing more than 4.000 meters , north-east of the cracks in the canyon Hrunagil. [21] [22] [23] According to indications, by mid-April 2010.
 was noted that the seismic activity around the volcano and that reduces the equilibrium process started. [24] 31 March has opened up new rifts, about 200 meters north-west of the original. [10] Geophysicist Einarsson Magnús Tumi has held press conference on 21st March and announced that the eruption is small compared with the eruption of volcano Hekla 2000th But since no cracks near the glacier, the risk of major flooding is minimal. [25] 22 March has been observed near areas of volcanic ash Fljótshlíð (20-25 km north-east of the eruption site) [5] and the city Hvolsvöllur (40 km north-west of the location of the eruption) [5]. 22nd March explosion threw smoke volcano 4 km in height, [26] and the next day another explosion was kicked out of the smoke to a height of 7 km. [27] Scientists on 22 March recorded a sudden increase in temperature of the river Kross (which draws its source from the glaciers and Eyjafjallajökull Mýrdalsjökull) Þórsmörk in the field, since the water temperature increased by 6 ° C in a span of just two hours, which has never before been recorded in the history of the river. [28 ] farmers near the volcano were warned that their stock may be drinking poisoned water sources, solid fluorides.
 [29] [30] [edit] Another eruption Satellite image of NASA&#39;s 14th volcanoes April 2010., after a short pause, again Eyjafjallajökull continued eruption, this time in the middle of the glacier, causing the ice to melt and flooding, which is why 800 people were evacuated. Markarfljót roads near the river in some places flooded. [31] It was a rare phenomenon: the so-called. &quot;Dirty storm&quot; of volcanic clouds that produces thunder and. [32] [33] According to estimates, the volcano has released about 104 milligrams of fluoride per kilogram of ash. Very quickly Icelandic volcano has become a European problem - and to what extent can not remember. The temperature of the volcano is a ton of dust rose high into the sky and there are air flow speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour began to spin out dirt to the continent of Europe. [34] [edit] Termination of air traffic, according to some estimates, the cold water from the melted ice is cooled parts lava and are fragmented into silicon.
 Smaller particles are ejected into the atmosphere during the eruption, which is dangerous for planes in flight. [35] Volcanic ash and dust cloud spread first by the north, and then in Central Europe, which many airports closed in the area. [ 36] [37] Volcanic ash cloud spread to Europe and caused the interruption of air traffic, 17/04/2010 Volcanic ash cloud spread to Europe and caused the interruption of air traffic, 19/04/2010 The cloud of ash reduced visibility of a small dust particles theoretically can be dissolved because of the heat engine turbine, and then harden and cause engine failure. [35] It was the biggest fine of air traffic in Europe since World War II. [38] Also, many passengers who travel worldwide in Europe are facing Terminated flights. The International Air Transport Association has estimated that aviation industry worldwide lost 148 million in € (200 million in $) per day due to the disruption of flights. [39] States that have closed all or part of the airports are: Austria, Belgium, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Croatia, Ireland, northern Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, northern Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom.
 Croatian authorities confirmed on 17 April to temporarily cancel all flights from 45 ° north latitude. Croatia Airlines has announced that he was losing € 500,000 a day due to indoor air traffic. [40] A cloud of dust spread throughout the night 18th April on the whole Croatian territory at all altitudes, and the highest concentration was at 7 to 11 kilometers. Helsinki: Airport closed due to volcanic dust simulations have shown that rare part of the cloud, which consists of diffuse and invisible to the eye of particles of volcanic ash, a few days to be above most of the Croatian, Croatian except over the south, officials from the MHS. It is open air space over the middle and southern Adriatic, and accordingly, 21 April at 9.30 it was decided to open the airport in Dubrovnik, Split and Zadar. [40] 16 April 2010., in Europe, canceled a total of about 16.000 28.000 daily passenger flights, a 17th
 16.000 from 22.000 in April flights were canceled for fear of safety for passengers. &quot;[41] National Center for Aviation reported that it was the first time in history that a natural disaster grounded the aircraft in the UK. The airspace was open even after the attacks of 11 September 2001. in the United States. [42] A total of around five million passengers trapped at airports because their flights canceled. [43] The Association of British Travel agents procjenuje that in April and up to one million Britons probably trapped abroad. [44] Professor Bill McGuire is judged to be the most famous Icelandic volcanic eruption of Laki those that occurred 1783rd, [45] broke the air traffic around the north of Europe for six months that happened today. &quot;[46] During this period, several British Air Line at your own risk rallied with airports runways, but without passengers, to determine whether a plane fly by small clouds of dust vukanske.
 The flights were uneventful mistakes. [47] 18 Germany in April has been partially re-opened its airspace for three hours so that passengers who were trapped in Portugal could land in Hanover. There were no recorded problems. [48] 17 April 2010., chairman of German airline Air Berlin said in an interview in Bild am Sonntag said that there is no risk of flight and a &quot;threat to vulkasnke dust nonexistent&quot; because it is based only on a computer simulation. [49] A spokesman for the company Lufthansa is also confirmed that their trial flights proceeded without any problems.
