The Guardian writes that all the isolated government in Dublin under a strong pressure to within twenty-four hours to declare whether it will accept international financial aid, because growing panic that the infestation came from upropa≈°tenog Irish banking sector could be extended to other economic weaker eurozone. The greatest pressure on the government in Dublin comes from Spain and Portugal, whose credit standing weakens sharply on suspicion of financial abilities of Ireland. Portugal is now on the verge and I asked for international help, says the Guardian. The Times writes that the government in Dublin resist taking the help, not only because it considers the humiliation and threats to their independence but also because it wants to keep the existing tax rate for foreign companies, which have made the country once the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot;. One of the conditions for getting help is that this tax increase, after which foreign investors have started to leave the country.
 Daily Telegraph estimates that Ireland will, at the insistence of Germany, the euro is considered glue that keeps Europe, still have to accept help. The London daily also warns that fund to help affected countries in the eurozone is not inexhaustible. First, we, the paper said, had Greece, now is the turn of Ireland, and the next stop is probably Portugal. The costs of these three countries could be to cover the 750 billion that Europe has at its disposal. But if the disease has spread to Spain, not to mention Italy, the story is completed, the Daily Telegraph.
