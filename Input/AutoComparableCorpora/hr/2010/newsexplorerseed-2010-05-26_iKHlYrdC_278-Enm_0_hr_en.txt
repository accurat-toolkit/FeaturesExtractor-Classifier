A full 24 hours before the fatal explosion occurred Deepwater Horizon oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, there were numerous warning signals which are said to be an explosion could occur. During the hearing before the U.S. Congress, representatives of British Petroleum have acknowledged that the measuring devices on the platform showed that the well enters a larger quantity of gas, which is one of the signs of the coming explosion. In addition, in an effort to rehabilitate the problem, pulled some moves that are most likely contributed to the explosion rather than prevent it. Cement mixed with mud, logs that are on platforms of water regularly show that a little after midnight and the morning when there was an explosion, all efforts were directed toward plugging holes and placing the cover over them so that the platform could be detached and moved to other wells. BP has been hired for the job company Halliburton, and it appears that the job was well done because of poor quality cement, and because it lowered into the well when mixed with mud.
 BP in one of his notes also stated that there were problems with the system of valves and hydraulic pumps that in case of damage should automatically plug hole, and at least five hours before the explosion. Some notes also show that the personnel on the platform ignored all the warnings. One hour before the accident, everyone had to be absolutely clear that things are out of control. Partial responsibility Although BP accepts responsibility for the shipwrecked, its leaders do not fail to emphasize that Transocean, the owner of the platform, is partly responsible for what happened. Committee of the House Energy and trade more than two weeks collecting evidence, but as the source of most of the data just BP, will be launched independent investigations.
