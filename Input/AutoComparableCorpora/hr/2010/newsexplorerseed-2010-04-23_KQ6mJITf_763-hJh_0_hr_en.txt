29/01/2009 - As in all previous months, 28 January, Hamas administration, all employees get their salaries. In dollar terms, as &quot;another proof&quot; - as claimed by the Jerusalem Post columnist - that &quot;the money delivered to Gaza smuggling channels. 30/01/2009 - justifying his country&#39;s policy toward Gaza, Israeli President Shimon Peres, at a meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said that &quot;Israel is not to blame for the tragedy of Gaza, but Hamas.&quot; &quot;Why are ispucavali rockets / Why fight us? &quot;he asked, and do not think twice stated that&quot; Gaza was not possessed &quot;and that&quot; not even one day starving &quot;(!). For this he received applause audience. The only thing he tried to oppose Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan. Not one Arab, not even Amr Musa, Secretary General of the Arab League, who participated in the same panel. 02/02/2009 - In Cairo has announced that the third month in Egypt to host international conference on the reconstruction of Gaza.
 The problem is not money, which is provided or promised, but: (1) Who will that organization be the contractor on the ground, (2) Who will determine the content and priorities and help, as it will be doturana in Gaza and who will check ways of its use? Arab League meeting in Kuwait established a fund of 2 billion U.S. dollars, which the Saudis and Katarci promised their contributions. For the same purpose, UN Secretary-General announced the allocation of 613 million U.S. dollars. The main funders, however - petrodolarski Arabs and Western Europeans - do not want to leave Gaza after the renewal of &quot;radical&quot; Hamas, and forcibly try the job entrusted to &quot;moderate&quot; Abbas and his phantom administration. Egypt, all these days in indirect talks mediated by Hamas and Fatah, Abbas is pushing. Hamas, however, controls the Gaza Strip, where Abbas&#39;s administration does not have access to, and will not willingly give up that role. Create additional problems for the Israelis, who claim the &quot;right&quot; verification purposes and to monitor the performance of each of the planned project, without which it would not allow open borders gazanskih.
 It should, therefore, somehow marginalize Hamas, or at least subordinated Abasovoj administration, and thus regain some of this lost credibility. E, and it will go hard, because Hamas, which the Israeli aggression was not eliminated, does not intend to capitulate, or in terms of reconstruction, even in terms of internal controls gazanskih borders. Could possibly agree to some compromise, which would Abasovoj formally assigned the role of passive extras. For it has good arguments, not only is the de facto husband in the Gaza Strip, but it is the last parliamentary elections, which most democratic ever held in the Arab world, swept in Gaza and the West Bank. In addition, Abbas&#39;s presidential term expired, while the &quot;government&quot; which presides no legitimacy. It is not confirmed by the Palestinian Legislative Council (parliament), dominated by Hamas lawmakers to whom he protustatutarno dismissed because of that.
 They did not help him any Israeli arrest of Hamas parliamentarians (one half of the total number of Palestinian representatives, including Speaker of Parliament, languishing in Israeli jails!). Abbas is true, at least on paper, yet the president and the PLO and Fatah. However, both organizations have virtually disintegrated. PLO, that &quot;the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people&quot; in whose name Arafat signed with Israel in the Oslo agreement, was no longer what it was, not only because it does not include Hamas, but the fact that Fatah, Arafat&#39;s organization, which is dominated PLO, broke up. Because of this situation, Abbas will not and is unable to convene a meeting of the Council of the PLO, where it remained in the minority. It could indeed count on the support of several satellite groups, which are co-opted various sinecures Arafat, but not much of his own Fatah, the so-called. &quot;young guard&quot;, led by the popular Marwan Fatahovac Barguti.
 This, in an Israeli prison, serving a five cumulative lifelong imprisonment (Hamas has demanded his release in exchange for Israeli Corporal Gilad Shalit). According to Abbas was a critical and Faruk Kadumi (Abu Lotof), a member of the &quot;Old Guard&quot;, Secretary General of Fatah and leader of the PLO&#39;s Political Bureau (Commission for International Relations), which operates between Tunis and Damascus. Abas can only rely on some sixty up to eighty thousand civilian and military employees, ie mercenaries, his Palestinian national administration. That number includes several thousand members of the so-called. &quot;Presidential Guard&quot;, a military trained and armed with American money in neighboring Jordan. These past few months mainly dealt with the arrest of Hamas activists in West Bank, and recently the suppression of manifestations of solidarity with Gaza. Hamas has, since its parliamentary election victory, insisted on the reconstruction of the PLO, which would be presented to the extent received support from the electorate.
 This would effectively mean that Fatah took over the lead in the roof structure of the Palestinian resistance. Since persistently refused to Abbas, Hamas&#39;s general secretary, Kaled Mashal, two days ago in Damascus announced the formation of an alternative organization, which, he said, truly represent the Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation. While this is perhaps just a trial balloon to occupy better positions in the Cairo talks, Abbas is terribly excited, and accused Hamas of undermining the Palestinian resistance and unity ..
 ************* In the meantime, the Egyptian authorities have begun to ask the Ga≈æanski border surveillance cameras and sensors, that would be allowed detection of underground tunnels. Americans they finally delivered the long-sought solutions. But it is not complied with their request to use at least one helicopter for air monitoring of the border zone. Specifically, the peace treaty with Israel, which was demilitarized Egyptian Sinai, Egypt has the right military control over its own side of the peninsula, including its air space ..
 ************* Obama&#39;s special envoy for the Middle East, George Mitchell, the day he visited this area of his new responsibilities, and visited Cairo, Tel Aviv, Ramallo, Aman and Riad. He was not in Gaza, and the last time canceled a visit to Ankara. In return he stopped in Paris and London. Mitchell is the mother of a Lebanese Christian, that is Arab. He knows the reality of the Middle East. Already during the Clinton adminstracije visited Obama&#39;s statement that America is &quot;committed to supporting the security of Israel&quot; and would &quot;always support the right of Israel to defend against the real danger,&quot; does not sound promising in this area. He was a successful broker in the reintegration of political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Northern Ireland&#39;s democratic system, which had stopped decades of Protestant-Catholic conflict. It was hoped that a man with such a reputation to be able to reactivate frozen &quot;peace process&quot;, that is, at least it was announced, should lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, with which to peacefully co-existed (two-state solution ).
 It might be possible when the new U.S. administration turned to the legacy rate-sided support for Israel, when they really decided to become an honest mediator (honest power-broker), which for now is not likely. Neither Obama&#39;s statement during the inauguration of Mitchell, that America is &quot;committed to supporting the security of Israel&quot; and would &quot;always support the right of Israel to defend against the real danger,&quot; does not sound promising ..
 ************** Not promising any forecasts on the outcome of Israeli elections, according to which right-wing Likud conceivably lead ahead of Kadima, Labor and the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenua. With Netanyahu, prime minister in the chair, which is opposed to any real compromise with the Palestinians, the prospects for a political resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are nil. Personally, I think, I wrote about this, that no formula of &quot;two states&quot;, on the one hand - a regional power as Israel, on the other - bantustaniziranog para-state apparatus, and crippled the Palestinian entity, which has no control over its allocated limit, over their airspace and sea, over the import-export, deprived of water and electricity, not a solution ..
 ************** In spite of two &quot;unilateral ceasefire&quot; with the territory gazanskog daily fires a couple of missiles at Israel, as Israel match air and missile bombardment. Intensively again will fire tunnels along the Egyptian border . No one was injured by Palestinian missiles, while the killed and wounded several Palestinians. So, everything is back to the situation since before December 27 ..
 *************** Egyptian state media kept repeating that the greatest problem that the Palestinians are divided into two opposing camps - the government of Abbas, who controls the West Bank and Gaza Strip, controlled by Hamas - which is why are uniquely able to confront and negotiate with Israel. So Cairo mediate in their dispute. The main mediator of the head of Egyptian Intelligence Services Omar Suleiman, whose function in advance about the Egyptian approach to the Palestinian-Israeli problem. But here I wanted to explain why the problem of the West Bank, sometimes called Cisjordanijom, and since Israel Judea and Samaria, a lot more serious than Gaza. West Bank, which included East Jerusalem, the notional capital of a future Palestinian state, the Oslo Agreement is divided into three zones. A small portion, with the center in Ramallah, left the Palestinian civilian administration and its security forces, in the second, something most part, Israeli forces take care of security, while the Palestinian Authority is left to local administrations; third most part, the &quot;military zone&quot; , which the Palestinian Authority does not have access.
 The intention was, at least on paper, that all three zones are eventually united under a single Palestinian Authority, and that, along with the Gaza Strip, are a component of a future Palestinian state. Developments, however, went in the opposite direction: first, the first zone, which included East Jerusalem, was unilaterally reorganized - both are part of Jerusalem Israel municipalitetu single subject, and so unified urban area was declared the capital of Israel, the second step is made with the construction of the &quot;wall of separation&quot; (International Court of Justice declared it illegal), which surveyed the state of Israel zapadnoobalski additional territory; Third, in parallel with the preceding, the continued building of Israeli settlements in the first zone, with the aim of completely separating Jerusalem from the rest of the West coast; fourth, in the second zone, a few months ago, Israelis have given the Palestinian Authority &quot;full authority&quot; over several municipaliteta, which were previously separated from each other strategic roads and checkpoints, the fifth, the third military zone, where nothing is changed, part of the Palestinian West Bank, separated from access to the Jordan River, from which the neighboring Hashemite kingdom of Israel and I supply the water (with what the Israeli government, in its sole discretion, to sell certain quantities of water and the Palestinian municipalitetima).
 Amputation of East Jerusalem, the &quot;wall of separation&quot;, a system of separate zones, expansion of &quot;legitimate&quot; and &quot;illegal&quot; Israeli settlements, a network of strategic roads and checkpoints - Israel is still de facto appropriated, contrary to all norms of international law, about 45 percent of the territory of Western coast. And this robbery is continuing. Abbas and his Palestinian National Authority &quot;independently&quot; controlling about 20% of the area. Financial transfers from living on what they paid the Israeli side of the taxi that collects on Palestinian goods traffic. And these payments are not automatic and regular, but always arrive with a delay, at the discretion of Tel Aviv. So Abbas is autonomous in its management of the West Bank. On the website of the Israeli organization Peace Now (Yesh Din), can read the conclusions of the investigations and reports, including the precise shots from the air, which are meticulously documented massive confiscation of Palestinian territory and municipalnog usurping Palestinian private property.
 The so-called. &quot;Legal&quot; naseljeniƒçke colonies are generally built on confiscated land in public ownership, while the &quot;illegal&quot; Nice and went out into usurped the parcels from private owners. But the &quot;legal&quot; in a diary, &quot;Haaretz&quot; has concluded that the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank is &quot;the systematic trampling of international law and the rights of private Palestinian owners.&quot; Defense Minister Barak has banned publication of the article, because this would &quot;endanger national security.&quot; Majority of cases, further usurped private Palestinian land. It started to build a police station or gas station, school or synagogue, and followed the housing units. So built settlements would then be mutually connected with the road network within the exclusive use of the occupation authorities and settlers. The road separating the Palestinian villages from each other and their citizens from accessing the fields and orchards, of which they lived.
 In some cases they were also denied access to clinics, hospitals and schools, and even access to their municipalnoj administration. Despite all these hardships, the life of Palestinians under the Israeli occupation of the West Bank is much better than their compatriots in the Gaza Strip, which Israel evacuated again now. On the West Coast at least not starve and its residents do not fear a sudden bombing and rocket attack. Those among them who are not expose himself in opposition to the occupation or to Abbas, the exceptions do not kill, but only arrested. Recently, the Israeli daily Haaretz got hold of the elements of a secret report prepared for the Ministry of Defence. It was signed by General Baruch Spiegel after determining the situation on the ground. He concluded that expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank is &quot;the systematic trampling of international law and the rights of private Palestinian owners.&quot; Defence Minister Barak has banned its publication, because that would &quot;jeopardize national security.&quot; Neither the Israeli government has not genuinely keen to promote sustainable Palestinian state in its neighborhood.
 Conflict Hamas and Fatah, and the establishment of rival Palestinian administration in two separate territories benefit Israel. The longer this duality is maintained, the better for Israeli hawks who excel in all parties. Epilogue: Signposts in Washington, Israeli hawks 12/02/2009 - The final outcome of Israeli elections is unclear. It is only clear that the &quot;right&quot; has progressed, and the &quot;Left&quot; have receded, although these ideological labels very mixed. Barak Labour Party, which fell to fourth place in the number of deputies (13), making her the first time now happened a long time is not &quot;left&quot;. Left Meretz voters pause, antagonized opportunism of their own leaders and frightened by the popularity of nationalist ultra-right wing, not voted no for their own candidates, even for the Labour party, but for a &quot;centrist&quot; Kadima, which is thanks to them, with 28 seats, against all forecasts, took first place.
 With just one less representative (27), Netanyahu&#39;s Likud is another. And Bibi and Livni declared victory. &quot;Both aspire to the position of prime minister. However, with 15 elected deputies, the first plan broke out Lieberman and his ultranationalistic Any future Israeli government will continue guslati the&quot; peace process &quot;whose&quot; Links &quot;not set in Tel Aviv, but in Israel Beytenu Washingtonu.Yisrael. They will depend on what will eventually agree on a coalition. The religious parties - Shas with 11 and United Judaic Torah Party with 5 members - although the dogmatic right, will be joined at the end one mandatary that they no longer offer. For now, it is uncertain who it will be. wrangling, the English call them horse trading (trade horses), I can take. It is not excluded &quot;grand coalition&quot;. In the meantime, Olmert, in vi≈°emjeseƒçnoj resignation, and still perform the &quot;technical&quot; After the premiere (as such - and this led to last war).
 Interestingly, although many did not went to the polls, most Israeli Arabs voted for Kadima and Likud, not Labor Party or for its own fragmented stranƒçice. This proves his &quot;loyalty&quot; of their country. But, by no means neglectable role in the &quot;right deviation&quot; of the Israeli electorate, was played by Hamas, which is seen as a major risk Israeli security. The fact that he survived the attack on Gaza before the Israeli elections, was even more intensified this perception. According to the inherited stereotypes, many commentators have held precisely the outcome of the election suggest that the coalition &quot;of right&quot; tandem Netanyahu and Lieberman, along with sekundiranje religious parties, was dangerous to continue or restart the famous &quot;peace process&quot;. In support of these claims go the following arguments: ( 1) Likudov statute, which explicitly rejects the concept of ceding territory (of course - an imaginary Greater Israel) in exchange for peace, without which it is pointless forcing the idea of creating some kind of Palestinian state, it is pointless to negotiate about it, although it is precisely this goal &quot;peace process&quot; (2) the Netanyahu opposes any withdrawal from the West Bank and freeze the process of building Israeli settlements in that territory, and consistently advocates the &quot;complete destruction of Hamas&quot;, (3) Lieberman, who is more extreme, the public requires ejection / expulsion of all Israeli Arabs.
 All this is true, but Haaretzov correspondent Zeev Avrahami, who considers himself a &quot;leftist&quot;, reminiscent of some historical facts (Hawks Can Only Promise Peace Spiegel Online International, 2 February 2009). &quot;Left&quot; is led by the Labour Party, the ruling Israel since its creation 1948th year until 1977. led four successful war against the Arabs, who have not resulted in peace. After the war of 1967. its just started to sprout immigrant settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. &quot;Rightist&quot; Begin won the elections 1977th and he was with Egyptian President Sadat signed a peace treaty. Another &quot;rightist&quot;, Shamir, was among participants in the Madrid Conference 1991st which were initiated negotiations with the Palestinians, culminating with the Oslo Agreement 1993rd year. The third &quot;hardliner&quot;, Netanyahu, who became Prime 2004th relinquish authority over Hebron, the West Bank, Palestinian Authority.
 Fourth in the series &quot;hawks&quot;, Sharon, won the 2004 elections. Promised evacuation of Gaza, which he did. Freshly &quot;centrist&quot; Olmert launched the failed Lebanon military expedition of 2006, and recently led the government &quot;left center&quot; was a driving force punitive expedition against Gaza, which was conceived and led the Labour Party Champion Barak. Abrahami concludes that just &quot;hawks&quot; have a chance to reach an agreement with the Palestinians for peace. I am thinking however that it is not decisive as to the coalition - &quot;right&quot; or &quot;right of center&quot; or &quot;left of center&quot; - in the end agree. Any future Israeli government will continue guslati the &quot;peace process&quot;, which is &quot;signposts&quot; will set in Tel Aviv, but in Washington.
