President Barack Obama and his Democratic colleagues have tried using the TV once more to convince Americans to accept the proposed health care reform. Sedmosatni Democratic-Republican summit devoted to health care reform in the United States ended, as expected, without an agreement. The meeting was attended by 40 members of Congress. The current plan that would allow health insurance for 30-odd million uninsured people is completely unacceptable, say Republicans. Too expensive and it is a direct government interference in free markets. Unacceptable and jednoipolmjeseƒçni time, how he gave Mr. Obama, the convergence of views of Democrats and Republicans. I do not know whether we can overcome these differences. Maybe people will by the end of the day still say that we have major disagreements. People want to hear whether the differences between Republicans and Democrats prevail, want to know if this is really discussions or shops.
 I hope this is not political theater in which she plays on camera, &quot;said Obama. Democrats have recently lost two-thirds majority in the Senate. However, if the Republicans continue to resist further bill, the White House could resort to the procedure by which to accept the controversial law requires only a simple majority of 51 senators.
