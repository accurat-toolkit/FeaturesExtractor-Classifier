And Tito is coming to him by Sir Elijah worth of Paklar near Travnik already half a century guarding the sheep and produces high-quality vlašiæki cheese. His son Ante photographed, we first June when the snow fell on Galic fifteen centimeters. Then Anton said that after mining, the toughest job shepherds. However, his father, Elijah does not think so. Family Tradition - Our family tradition of producing quality cheese ovèjeg lasts more than 50 years. If I were born again, again I raised sheep and produced cheese. Since this job can be very good to live - says Elias. We asked if it is true that the price vlašiækog cheese came in just five KM - Possibly he had some shepherds and the producers who can not sell expensive.
 That&#39;s their problem, and I believe that the quality issue. My cheese is sold in advance. Kaæica Each has its own customer. When I could still produce so much as produced by a hundred sheep, all I could sell at 12 KM. I think that quality is crucial in the price - tells us Elijah as his wife Ljuba checks the water in the cheese. Elijah was up before the war had about 350 sheep which were brought him huge profits after selling cheese and lambs. Work with sheep cheese and flourished, and all members of the family had a permanent job. - Those were golden times. It was full steam, and money has never lacked. My cheese is tasted when Josip Broz Tito came to Bugojno. Advance to announce that for him to save kaæicu and had to be extra cheese. Never had any complaints. On the contrary I have always received praise and awards for their product. However, I recently traveled to the Republic of Croatia, son, when in Bihac see a supermarket on the window says - vlašiæki cheese.
 Where in Bihac vlašiæki sir? Same thing in Kupres. It can not be made in Kupres vlašiæki cheese. Grass, air temperature, milk, experience, all this affects the quality of cheese. We are proud that most cheese sold in Sarajevo, and to known customers - adds Elias. Poor even for bread when we asked Elijah if there is now someone important in politics that he gave kaæicu cheese as it used to be Tito, Elijah responded:-I can not say no to politicians who deserve my cheese, but it bothers me when I hear the transistor to the three thousand marks obtained another 500 KM increase salaries, and poor there is no bread. I prefer the cheese gave a good doctor. For next year, getting old, so the more sought-after doctor - says at the end of our conversation, Elijah Valid from Paklar who, njegujuæi family tradition, managed to preserve manufacturing vlašiækoga cheese without additives 24.07.2010. u 17:29 • 0 Comments • Print • # Tuesday, 13.07.2010.
