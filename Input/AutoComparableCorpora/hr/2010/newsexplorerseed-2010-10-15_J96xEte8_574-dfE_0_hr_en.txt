Their research provides answers to the question why many people remain unemployed, despite the large number of unfilled jobs, according to the award citation. &quot;Laureates have presented a model which helps us to understand the correlation between legal regulations and economic policies on the one hand and unemployment, vacancies and wages on the other hand,&quot; the statement said the Swedish Academy. According to traditional theory, the labor market should function independently, while seekers find available jobs, thereby establishing an equilibrium. Diamond, Mortensen and Pissarides showed his model, which is known by their initials DMP model, the market does not always work like that. So because of small disturbances by those who seek work will not always find employers seeking workers. For example, additional costs for employers may not hire workers even though they need them.
 Model DMP also provides explanations for the unemployment that is not weak either in terms of improvement in the economy. Laureates also help identify areas of regulatory measures, suggesting that those governments can boost employment and prevent long-term unemployment through vocational education.
