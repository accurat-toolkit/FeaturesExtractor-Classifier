- We knew when we play against, well organized team of excellent breaks. However, against this team, we have created several clear the situation, but again we had a realization. Too bad, because we&#39;ve gone for 2-3 weeks we would be much stronger and able to deal equally with the opponent in the 4th Champions League qualifying round. Now we go on makeup, playing for the European league, and what was our original goal - said Zajec. He congratulated his players on the actions and combinatorics, but not the realization, and then congratulated supporters arguing that such an environment has long been seen in Maksimir. He praised the blue section of the young coach Ariana Ademi and builders Badelj Milan game, and thinks that he hit the front position of a young Etta VRSALJKO. - Etto was good and harmful to the goal. Why is Rukavina played for so long, and it is ready in less than an hour? - Do you have a better solution - retorted Zajec a counter.
 Rukavina is well presented by the audience, and of course we expect him to so much more. Bunn said he was still constantly practiced penalty kicks, the last time on Monday. - Players are very difficult, I hope to you. They have made the most of themselves, provided a lot of emotions and desires, and now will be quite difficult to go back - he said Zajec.
