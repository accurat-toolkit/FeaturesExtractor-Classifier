The shipment of uranium to Russia, whose rail transport on Tuesday to prevent activists from Greenpeace, the ship was overloaded. Ship in the night on Thursday sailed from the French port of Le Havre in St. Petersburg, according to information from the organization of nature protection and management of the port. Greenpeace activists made a living chain on Tuesday morning on the railway line and at the entrance to the factory for enriching Eurodif (Areva group) within nuclear power plants in Tricastin Pierrelatteu, in southeast France, preventing the departure of the composition. The blockade was discontinued after ten o&#39;clock, when the police arrived and chased the activists. The train went into Tuesday night, but not in Cherbourg as originally planned, but in Le Havre, where the uranium was loaded on a cargo ship Kapitan Kuroptjev which sails under the Maltese flag. The ship sailed on Thursday for St. Petersburg. One of the Greenpeace spokesman Axel Renaudin said he was pleased with this action, &quot;which was forced to change direction Areva times.
 Greenpeace seeks moratorium on such deliveries noting that this is not about uranium, but about nuclear waste. Areva argues that it is a shipment of uranium hexafluoride, which will be enriched in Russia, then returned to France, where they will be reprocessed into nuclear fuel. The shipment is part of the contract which expires in late 2010.
