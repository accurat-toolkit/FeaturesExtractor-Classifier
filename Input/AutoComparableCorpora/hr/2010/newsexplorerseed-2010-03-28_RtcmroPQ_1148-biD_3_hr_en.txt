http://www.euromedica.hr/ My meeting with the staff of this clinic was from the beginning to the end of a horrible and uncomfortable. I needed an urgent review of vessels of the neck, I asked what is the cost and because it was cheaper than 100 EUR in other clinics, I was commissioned. I&#39;m 5 minutes late because I could not find a nurse began to yell at me as to why the late, bla bla bla ... Well, pregrmim ... I come to the doctor, he asks me a referral, but only verbally asked me what I need, I say to him and he hits me all ok, a polite and calm. I finished, I go to wait for a printed report and account, and it turns out 150 kn higher price than what we agreed. Looking for head to explain to me and show rates. Turns out that we examined except vessels of the neck vessels of the head over and what is of course an additional fee, and I did not ask what I should not!! The head is yelling at me that I have no right, what I showed him a referral ... And of course, watching from above like the fool ...
 I paid, but I called home and told what happened and the head nafiksao my boyfriend and my money back! Yet. Be careful and always argue for their money!
