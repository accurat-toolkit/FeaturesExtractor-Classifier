International Space Station - ISS) has developed an international research station that is currently being drawn up in Earth&#39;s lower orbit. Work on drafting the universe began in 1998. with planned completion by 2011. The station will remain in service at least until 2020. With a mass greater than any previous space station, ISS can be seen with the naked eye from Earth [7], and from 2010. largest man-made satellite to orbit the Earth. [8] serves as a research lab with mikrogravitacijskim conditions in which the crew performed eskperimente the fields of biology, human biology, physics, astronomy and meteorology. [9] [10] [11] The station has a unique environment for testing of spacecraft that will be used for missions to the moon and Mars. [12] is managed by the crew and the Expedition is permanently inhabited by second
  Scientists on Earth have quick access to data of the crew in space which enables them to quickly modify or initiate new experiments - something not possible in specialized unmanned aircraft. [25] Crews, who reside at the station for several months, performing scientific experiments every day. [ 9] [26] By the end of Expedition 15 crew, the station was carried out 138 major studies, [27] and the scientific discoveries in the fields of science base to completely new research, published every month. [12] ISS provides (with its Located in the relative safety of the Earth&#39;s orbit) testing of space systems that will be needed for long-term mission to the moon and Mars. Provides experience in maintaining and repairing the system in space that will be crucial in the management of space ships on long voyages. [Edit] Scientific research comparing the heat of the Earth (left) and fire mikrogravitacijskim conditions prevailing on the ISS (right).
 ISS is a platform where they can conduct various experiments that require unusual conditions prevailing at the station. Main research areas are aerospace medicine, life sciences, physical science, astronomy and meteorology. [9] [10] [11] Authorization Act of 2005., NASA has designated the American segment of the station as a national laboratory with the aim of increasing the use of ISS by other federal agencies and the private sector. [28] Research on the ISS reveal new facts about consequences of long-term stay in space. So currently studying muscle atrophy, osteoporosis and fluid movement, on the basis of whose results would be able to conclude whether the kolonizacjia universe and the possible long-term space flights. According to information received by 2006., Bone loss and atrophy mišćna suggest that there is a high risk of fractures and problems with movement after the astronauts landed on another planet because of the long inter-planetary times (such as
 six-month journey to Mars). [29] [30] More important medical research being conducted by &quot;National Institute for Space and Biomedical Research&quot; (Eng. and National Space Biomedical Research Institute). Emphasis is on the study in which astronauts guided by experts on earth, performed ultrasound examinations. There are taken into account the diagnosis and treatment of illness in the universe since the crew becomes often do not find doctors. It is anticipated that this view mode &quot;from afar&quot; to find applications on Earth, particularly in rural areas where expertise is not available. [31] [edit] Structure [edit] Drafting Assembly of the International Space Station, a major undertaking in the space architecture, began in November 1998. [2] The astronauts connected component becomes the spacewalks. To 27 November 2009., carried them 136, 849 provedevši hours outside the spacecraft in the tasks of constructing and maintaining the station.
 The preparation of becoming the first segment of the ISS, the Zarya module, was launched into space 20th November 1998. using a Russian Proton rocket. Delivered by Space Shuttle (STS-88), Unity module joined him two weeks later. In July 2000. existing configuration is added to the Russian Zvezda module of the station allow the permanent crew of three members. The first crew, Expedition 1, the station came in November 2000. using the Soyuz TM-31. The next two years the station was rebuilt and continued. Soyuz-U rocket passed a connecting section Pierce, Space Shuttle Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour are made laboratory Destiny, airlock Quest, Canadarm2 robotic arm and several other parts. [32] Expanding slowly becomes a disaster Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-107) 2003rd The preparation was resumed 2005th the launch of mission STS-114. [33] [edit] Life at the station [edit] Schedule times are in use at the station is Coordinated Universal Time (Eng.
 Coordinated Universal Time - UTC). As the station every day sees 16 sunrise and sunset, during the &quot;night hours&quot; to cover the windows to create an illusory sense of the night. During a visit to the Space Shuttle, ISS crews usually used during Space Shuttle missions (Mission Elapsed Time - MET). As the MET and the UTC time often do not overlap, the crew becomes necessary to adjust their sleep before the arrival of the Space Shuttle. [34] A typical working day starts waking up at 06:00, followed by a morning review of the station. Before the 08:10 start working, the crew eats breakfast, and participate in the conference with Mission Control. Below are the first daily exercise, after which the crew worked until 13:05 when they have a one-hour lunch break. The afternoon consists of additional exercises and performing until 19:30, when the crew dinner and performs a variety of activities before bedtime, which starts at 21:30. Overall, the crew works 10 hours a day during working days and 5 hours on Saturday while the rest of the time they can use for your own relaxation, entertainment or reimbursement missed. [35] [edit] Sleeping in space astronautiknja American Peggy Whitson at the entrance to a temporary sleeping area for each permanent member of the crew accommodation is provided at the station.
 Two sleeping areas are located in the Russian segment, while four more (which should be situated in a module Tranquillity) scattered by the American segment of the station. In U.S. cubicles are soundproof, a crew member is provided with a night light, bookshelf, desk and connection for laptop. [36] The crew planned a visit to the &quot;normal&quot; sleeping bag that must be fixed to the wall as in a dream not would be floated around and damage sensitive equipment. [37] For normal funkcionirnaje cabin is an important and a good ventilation system since around the head astronuta can form a cloud of carbon dioxide as a byproduct of respiration. [38] [edit] Hygiene Since the draft was removed Habitation Module , the station is equipped with a shower. Instead, the crew uses a water spray and wet rags to maintain hygiene. Available to them and shampoo and edible toothpaste in order to conserve water. [37] [edit] Food Most foods on the station comes in frozen or canned form.
