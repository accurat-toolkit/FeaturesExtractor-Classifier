British Prime Minister David Cameron has said openly what he had in mind during a visit to Turkey and India, and the media started asking questions whether this is happening because of his inexperience, or a new approach to diplomacy. First, it caused anger in Israel for a visit to Turkey saying that the Gaza prison camp &quot;, and then insulted an official Islamabad where the Indian audience in Bangalore, said that Pakistan had&quot; promoted the export of terror. &quot; In Ankara has also said that opponents of Turkish membership in the European Union &quot;protectionists, polarized and loaded bias&quot;, with which probably would not have agreed Paris and Berlin who oppose Turkish membership, according to Reuters. &gt;&gt; Cameron members of the government banned the use of cell phones &quot;I think it&#39;s important to talk openly about these things friendly countries,&quot; Cameron said in an interview with British media on Thursday. &quot;Taxpayers do not pay me to people around the world say what they want to hear.
 Honest I was before, I will be in the future, &quot;he said. Cameron (43) is the youngest British prime minister in nearly two centuries, while in office from May. His words about Pakistan, caused excitement in the Indian media, but Pakistan&#39;s diplomatic representative in Britain does not have the same feeling. &quot;His statement was in stark contrast with the situation on the ground. The bilateral visit to India aimed at strengthening commercial ties could take without compromising prospects for peace in the region, &quot;Wajid Shamsul wrote in his column in Britain&#39;s Guardian. The Israeli ambassador to Britain, Ron Prosor, was also not impressed by what Cameron said in Turkey . People in Gaza are prisoners of the terrorist organization Hamas, said in a brief commentary. Minister of Foreign Affairs William Hague found himself on Thursday also under &quot;fire&quot; journalists&#39; questions on whether Prime Minister Cameron might choose words more carefully.
