Tags: al Qaeda, terrorism 19:30 Cameron: The threat of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan is slightly smaller British Prime Minister David Cameron on Monday said the threat of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan a little less, but the progress is still can be &quot;spoiled&quot; and that Afghanistan still needed &quot;political progress&quot;. In a speech before members of parliament, after returning from a visit to Afghanistan last week, Cameron said the joint efforts of international and Afghan and Pakistani military forces made substantial progress. &quot;I am informed that the threat of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is less than before, but we also say that, when there would not be British and other international forces, Al-Qaeda back into Afghanistan and to increase threat to the United Kingdom, &quot;he said.
 Cameron noted the progress that is evident in the ranks of the Afghan national army and that in the six-month period, more precisely to March 2010., Afghan military forces joined the 17 000 recruits, which is 20 percent more than in the earlier period. Nevertheless, the Afghan police are not effective and can not cover all of Afghanistan&#39;s provinces. Successfully operates in only six of 13 provinces. Cameron said that efforts to assist Afghan security forces are key to the overall strategy of action of international coalition forces, and their main goal is to expel the Taliban from the villages and towns.
