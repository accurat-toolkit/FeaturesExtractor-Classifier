Like (3) | I do not like (0) bristle you still when someone (probably mistakenly) on the radio let Axelle Red &amp; Youssou N&#39;Dour and their anthem World Cup in France in 1998? If not, then you are probably younger than 18 years (we will not blame you), or prefer Sevkinu &#39;girl from the country&#39; that had inadvertently become a trademark Vatreni during the World Cup in 1998. (Which will be free to blame you) this year&#39;s World Cup have announced at least two hymns. One official Coca-Cola (and so presumably the SP) and the other, the FIFA official. The first is of course K&#39;naan &#39;Wavin&#39; Flag &#39;and the other Shakira&#39;s &quot;Waka Waka&#39;. The question for the million as follows: Do you know which song was the official anthem of the World Cup in Germany where he played and Croatia? Not the Konzum no Å½ujina but official. Anyways, here&#39;s a reminder that the song was the official (and less official) World Cup anthem. Tradition, however, is not that long, but you must have forgotten that they worked for Koxbox Fifu Morricone, Vangelis, Placido Domingo ...
