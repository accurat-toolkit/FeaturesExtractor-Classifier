Both leaders, as well as Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, the third strongest party, held Tuesday and Wednesday a series of rallies at which they are now trying to attract undecided one-third of British voters. According to a survey ComResa for TV channel ITV and the newspaper The Independent, the Conservatives lead with 37 per cent ahead of Labour with 29 and Liberal Democrats with 26 percent of the vote. This is a solid conservative who benefits is not sufficient for an absolute majority in the 650-member parliament, and Cameron does not guarantee entry into Downing Street. Daily Guardian, which has traditionally supported Labour, announced that he supported the Liberal Democrats, while the Times was the first time in the last 18 years supported the conservatives. And the weekly Economist, who supported the Labour party of Tony Blair, urged citizens to vote for conservatives. British majority voting system, in which the mandate winning candidate with the most votes in each constituency, even the Labour Party could provide the largest number of MPs.
 Polls suggest that neither of the two major parties will have an absolute majority, and the fate of future governments to lie in the hands Cleggovih Liberal Democrats. Great Britain was in 1974. had a similar situation and its political elite is used to create a coalition government, which is common in most European countries. According to British tradition, the head of the party that wins the most representative in the lower house of parliament becomes prime minister. However, the chances are that no party achieved an absolute majority of 326 seats and the coalition will be inevitable. The British electoral system could enable the Labour Party to obtain the largest number of seats even if the percentage of votes to be conquered at the second and even third place. In contrast, Clegg would be a score of 30 percent of the vote could get only 12 percent of parliamentary seats. (Reuters)
