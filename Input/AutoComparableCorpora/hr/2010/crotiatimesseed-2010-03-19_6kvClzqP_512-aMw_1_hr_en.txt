If you find a possibility to reach a settlement out of court about issues that are the subject of the complaint, then the complaint does not make sense. It is a matter of agreement, good will and actions of both the government - said in Opatija on the Croatian president JosipoviÄ‡ after meeting with Tadic. - It would be good to have this issue too is not internationalize, but to resolve out of court settlement - agreed to Tadic, adding that this does not mean we should abandon the prosecution of individuals who have committed war crimes.
