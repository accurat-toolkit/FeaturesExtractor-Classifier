Several times I have already refuted falsehoods that will demolish the HDZ. I&#39;ve had it all to know how I&#39;m going to act before asking me anything. These words Mario Zubović, somewhat annoyed by the media which regularly rank among the coup plotters who will lend a hand to his former party chief, denied that, together with Ivo Sanader, is moving in the demolition of the HDZ. In political circles shortly after returning Sanader in the parliamentary benches began to compute his loyal deputies. In Sanader loyal staff are counted so, but Zubovic, and Split Architect Jerko Rosin, Parliament Speaker Luka Bebic and former unionist Boris Kunst. In the event that triggers Matkovic their mandate and decides to move to the independent agent, Mr. Sanader should have enough hands, together with the SDP and the rest of the opposition, or go into the demolition of Kosor. Mario Zubović / Photo: Damir Tadić / Getty No worries chief HDZ parliamentary Group of the Hebrang said that he does not care combinations Sanader because he is convinced that the former prime minister will not raise enough hands in parliament to overturn the Government of the HDZ.
 - Do not worry because it is about people who are aware of their historical responsibility and who know that any threat to the Government at this moment meant to stop the process of joining the European Union, the fight against corruption and out of the crisis - the resolute Hebrang. HDZ at the moment there is excess of five members, enough to calm the ruling coalition survives vote of no confidence by the parliament requested SDP. If, however, Sanader on his side managed to collect five more HDZ, the fate of Kosor again be found for the first time after she was prime minister in July left the bat, in Sanader&#39;s hands. The HDZ are aware that the friendship of the people associated with Sanader, and estimate that between them their first PM to seek allies, since the founding of the Club members, with Sanader, needs the support of only two parliamentarians. Man and furrows Jerko Rosin did not want to commit themselves more detail about its further actions saying that everything about the topic already said before.
 - A man is known by the furrow, which leaves behind. According to the furrow can be assessed and plow and Oracle - the mysterious Rosin, who has until now always emphasized their loyalty to the HDZ, but he never hid any of his friendship with Sanader. More mysterious remained Matkovic, who did not want to reveal whether activated their mandate. - At this point it would not comment - said the former head of Sanader&#39;s cabinet. People close to Luke Bebic learned, however, that he is, no matter what is in the Parliament last week to protect Sanader, &quot;the tattoo of his career is not intended to be remembered as the destroyer of the HDZ. At the top of the ruling party are confident that the former prime minister will join Boris Kunst. He may not be the most skilled manner immediately denied the story that in komplotu with Sanader, but we are confident in his loyalty, according to the HDZ, Sanader was assured that the present position of losing a much smaller magnet than it was at the time when he was Prime Minister .
 How are right, will only be the moment when Ivo Sanader your bedroom within the HDZ to sign to go into action. Then they will actually see how the former prime minister really strong, and how much is the story of yet another coup of his delusion ... Marina Karlovic SABOLIĆ Hebrang attack, but is justified Bebić Although the president of the HDZ club Hebrang in &quot;Slobodna Dalmacija&quot; announced will seek the ruling party&#39;s Club before continuing this week&#39;s session of parliament debate on the procedures Speaker Luka Bebic, it still does not know whether they would HDZ on Tuesday to put the issue on the agenda of the party meeting. Bebic, as is known, has not acted on Friday to wish and not Habrangovoj gatherings of former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader in the last pew at Pančića edges, but it was temporarily sent to the place of his former deputy Eager Podrug among HDZ representatives. I havent Bebić yesterday refused to comment on allegations the party vice Habranga, which assures that the head of parliament deal crudely played out, causing discomfort throughout the party.
 However, people in Circle Bebic explain to us how he did not intend to intensify the situation as it turned out. Specifically, explaining that neither the club nor Hebrang HDZ did not prepare a written application in which they sought to be based on Article 36 Rules, which states that the Presidency of the Parliament determines the representative of the hall on the basis of membership in a particular caucus, designated place outside the bench for Sanader HDZ, a Bebic reportedly estimated that it can not respond to oral and informal Habrangov request. Will this be enough explanation for who knows how many times a temporary calm passions in the party and fully patch the torn relationship between the port Bebić - Hebrang, we&#39;ll see after today&#39;s session of the Group of the HDZ-aabk
