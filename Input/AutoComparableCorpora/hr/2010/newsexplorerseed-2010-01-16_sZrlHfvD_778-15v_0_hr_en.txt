He added that the United States ignored the request of Beijing to suspend the sale. &quot;The United States should respect the vital interests of China and the urgent pull this wrong decision that relations between the two countries would not be disturbed,&quot; said Chinese Foreign Minister. Such a move threatens U.S. national security and China&#39;s great task of reunification with Taiwan, &quot;said Jang. Washington on Friday announced that the U.S. will sell Taiwan missiles of the&quot; patriot &quot;helicopter&quot; Black Hawk &quot;and the minesweeper ships with a value of 6.4 billions of dollars. &quot;China is determined that there is no compromise when it comes to its sovereignty and integrity. The Chinese army is ready to respond to any threat in relation to the sovereignty, integrity and national security. We demand from the United States to respect our interests and urgently withdraw this wrong decision that relations between the two countries would not be disturbed, &quot;said Defense Ministry spokesman Ku Huan Ping.
 Beijing is because, first, the U.S. announced sanctions against companies if they participated in sales and reduction of contacts with the United States unless the agreement is canceled. The U.S. State Department yesterday announced that the U.S. regrets that China has announced the suspension of relations with Washington and penalties for U.S. companies to participate in Taiwan arms sales. China opposes arms sales to Taiwan, which it considers its sovereign territory. Taiwan, with over 22 million inhabitants, has one of the most developed economies in Asia and a strong and well-equipped armed forces with more than 300,000 members. Relations between the U.S. and China in the field of defense have already been strained for several years because of the Taiwan issue.
