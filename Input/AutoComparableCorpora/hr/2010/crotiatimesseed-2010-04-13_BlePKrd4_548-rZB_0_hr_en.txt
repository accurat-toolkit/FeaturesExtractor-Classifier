Their visit to Sweden and Kläppen was organized with the assistance of the sponsors of our Association in Sweden. In addition to the presidency ASS84 decided that the girls from the cash register of the association pays for 500 SEK as pocket money during their stay in Kläppen-in. Several of our members, mostly women, is however considered that it would be good if members of their associations Donations little help to make this allowance was still slightly higher. Thus was born an initiative that was conducted during the evening on Tuesday 30 March. Snjezana Slavnic the front of the initiators of the idea, visited most of the houses where they were our members.

But as he said, Ms. Sadeta in part by publishing the letter, who does that and sins. Specifically, we announced that the campaign &quot;over the winter children from Bosnia and Herzegovina participates quote:&quot; ... Bosnian Association &quot;Neretva&quot; (presented at the presidency with sastaku gdj. Rabiah Arslanagic ... &quot;we want this opportunity to correct and point out that part of the action regarding transportation of children from airport to ski resorts Kläppen and running back GO Bosnian-Swedish alliance of women in what they are in the warmest thanks on behalf of children.
 Below we publish the letter obtained by where Sadeta Muric. Quote: &quot;... .. In reporting on the organization of transport for children from OGBH you listed the wrong information, which is in the GO Bosnian-Swedish alliance of women provoked a strong reaction. Calm because we know who does that and sins and believe that it was not intentional. The report you mentioned that it was organized Rabiah Arslanagic, sister ... what in general is of no importance. This lady is a very active member of the Union talking about the very commitments about these and similar questions, but the action takes Bosnian-Swedish alliance of women (www.bssz.se), and not any of its individual. OK will leave it behind, so here&#39;s some information. In Sweden, the organized 9 different associations and federations of Bosnians. Everyone has their own profile and your field of interest and activity. One such alliance and the Bosnian-Swedish alliance of women. There is an alliance of women who also works in its commitment with which we have a correct cooperation.
 It is therefore important to specify the organization of what works. Bosnian-Swedish Association of Women (President Nelson Jelacic) for many years supported OGBH in both these cases, the arrival of children on skiing has promised to finance the transportation to destination and back. The last group also provided lodging, because it was necessary. Our support this humane organization is reflected in the meetings and information about them, collecting financial aid, as well as on European and joining of new members. Among the broader activities of the humanitarian work we are one of the highlights of this work we continued. This action can help with transportation to and back Kläppen are organized with an understanding of Mr. Mustafa Setkic in Stockholm. So much of this time, I wish you a successful organization and reception of our homeland. Thank you do so, and humane gesture.
