Sun to Earth (U.S. Earth Hour, lit. Earth hour), a global event organized by WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature, eng. World Wide Fund for Nature also known as World Wildlife Fund, eng. World Wildlife Fund), a held last Saturday in March every year, urging households and businesses to fire their unnecessary lights and other electrical appliances for one hour to raise awareness about the need to take action on climate change. Sun to Earth was launched by WWF and The Sydney Morning Herald 2007th year when 2.2 million Sydney residents took part in switching off all unnecessary lights [1]. Following the example of Sydney, many other cities around the world have accepted the event 2008th The [2]. Sun to Earth 2010th held on 27 March 2010. 20:30 to 21:30 local time.

Sun to Earth 2009th occurred at 20:30 to 21:30 local time on 28th March 2009. year. 88 countries and 4088 cities participated in Earth Hour for the 2009th which is ten times more cities than the Sun for Earth 2008th (2008. Years and involved 400 cities) [7].
 One billion votes was declared target for Sun to planet Earth 2009. [8] in the context of the central United Nations Conference on Climate Change 2009th Among the participants in 2009. were the first United Nations Headquarters in New York [9]. Disclaimer UN estimates that his involvement will save $ 102 energy [10]. Reports indicate that the United States located at the top of the hour for participation in the Earth with an estimate of 80 million people, 318 cities and 8 countries participating. The Philippines has participated in over 647 cities or the 15 million Filipinos are estimated to participate in a one-hour lights off 20:30 to 21:30 local time. After that there was Greece with 484 participating cities and Australia with 309 [11] [12]. The Canadian province of Ontario without the city of Toronto has experienced a decline of 6% use electricity while Toronto experienced a decline of 15.1% (nearly doubled from 8.7% the previous year) since the eclipse many companies including significant CN Tower. [13 ] Swedish Svenska Kraftnät elektricitetni operator recorded a decline of 2.1% in energy consumption according to their predicted figures between 20:00 and 21.00.
 The next hour corresponding figure was 5% [14]. This is equivalent to spending approximately half a million households from a total of 4.5 million households in Sweden [15]. According to Vietnamese elektricitetnoj company, Vietnamese demand for electricity fell is 140,000 kWh during Earth Hour. Philippines managed to save 611 MWh of electricity during this period that the statements were just closing a dozen power plants on coal for one hour.

 Before 2008. The San Francisco has implemented its own program, &quot;Lights Out&quot; (Croatian Fight Light) in October [31]. In 2008. transferred to the 29th March to match the Australian Satom for planet Earth. This was also the year when the Sun to planet Earth has become an international event, and San Francisco was asked to be a partner city for Earth Hour. Rather than maintain a competitive event, San Francisco has decided to support the Sun to planet Earth and all efforts to move the lights around the Fight for the support of international events for Earth Hour. Since the Sun to Earth 2008th was on Saturday, many secondary schools in the Great Toronto participated in turning off half the lights in the class rooms during the last hour of school on Friday, 28 March 2008. Although the slogan is planet Earth Hour 2008th official gazette &quot;See the difference you can make&quot; (Croatian see the difference that you do), the official radio commercials ended with the slogan &quot;Dark city, bright idea&quot; (Croatian
 Dark city, bright idea). Tel Aviv has agreed to his watch for the planet Earth on Thursday, 27 March 2008. to avoid conflict with the Sabbath [32]. Dublin has moved its Sun Earth for between 21 and 22 hours because of its northern geographic location [33]. [Edit] Energy saved Colosseum darkened during Earth Hour 2008th Auditorio de Tenerife Twilight for Sun to Earth, according to Thai branch of the WWF Bangkok reduced the use of 73.34 megawatts of electricity, which is over an hour just 41.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide [34]. Bangkok Post reported different numbers of 165 megawatt-hours and 102 tons of carbon dioxide. It was reported as significantly lower compared to a similar campaign initiated by bangkočka City Hall in May last year when he saved 530 megawatt-hours with a simultaneous reduction of 143 tons of carbon dioxide emissions [35]. The Philippines is the Philippine Electricity Market Corp..
 recorded a drop in electricity consumption by about 78.63 megawatts in Metro Manila up to 102.2 megawatts on the island of Luzon [36]. The largest drop in demand of about 39 MW occurred at 20:14 hours in Metro Manila and about 116 MW at 20:34 hours in the network Luzon [37]. Toronto is a 900 megawatt-hours of electricity saved. 8.7% was saved when measured in relation to a typical Saturday night ožujsko [38]. Ireland has had the full reduction in electricity consumption of around 1.5% for the evening [39]. The three-hour period between 18:30 and 21:30 the reduction amounted to 50 megawatts, saving 150 megawatt hours, or approximately 60 tons of carbon dioxide. It is saving less than six Irish personal carbon release for the entire year [40]. Golden Gate Bridge and Marin Headlands public open space in the background before and during the (framework) for Earth Hour 2008th In Dubai, where external lighting on several major city attractions were shut down a street lighting in selected areas of subdued at 50%, elektricitetna and Water Board reported savings of 100 megawatt hours of electricity.
 This represented a 2.4% reduction in demand compared to before the class started [41]. Sky Tower in Auckland, New Zealand turned their usual floor lighting during Earth Hour, and then turned on again after that. The best result was seen in Christchurch, New Zealand. The city reported a 13% decline in the demand for electricity. Transpower, however, reported that New Zealand&#39;s energy consumption during Earth Hour was 335 MW which is more than 328 megawatts of average of previous two Saturday [42]. Melbourne, Australia was 10.1% save electricity. Sydney, a city that has participated in Earth Hour for the 2007th and 2008., skresao was 8.4% elektricitetne consumption. It is less than 10.2% from last year, but the executive director for Earth Hour Andy Ridley said that after faktoriranja margin of error to participate in this city was just the previous year [43] The worst results occurred in Calgary, Canada.
 Urban consumption increased 3.6% during the peak hour demand for electricity [44]. In Calgary, where the weather plays a major role in energy consumption, the city has experienced during the 12 ° C colder than the previous Saturday&#39;s temperatures were recorded [45]. [Edit] Celebrations around the world combined, these three photos show the Malaysian landmark Petronas Twin Towers in downtown Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to turn off their lights (from top to ground) to mark Earth Hour 28th March 2009. In Tel Aviv, Israel Knesiyata Hasekhela free concert was held at Rabin Square. The energy required to generate a concert by a group of cyclists who pedal-run generators. The rest of the energy obtained from the generators burning used oil falafelnog [51]. [Edit] Google Earth Hour also received free publicity from the Google corporation. From 12.00 am 29th March 2008.
 until the end of Earth Hour, Google&#39;s home page in the U.S., Colombia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland and the UK has been changed to a page with a black background. Their motto was &quot;We&#39;ve turned the lights out. Now it&#39;s your turn - Earth Hour&quot; (Croatian We turned off the lights. Now is your turn - Earth Hour) [54] Google, however, said that for 2009 . year will not change your site again in the black because of the confusion that has caused many users [55]. A common misconception is it that black backgrounds on the web page reduces the energy consumption of monitors, LCD monitors use a constant amount of energy regardless of the color displayed. This is not the case with organic LED monitors [56] although they are currently in popular use. [Edit] TV channels [edit] Earth Hour 2007th View of Sydney during Earth Hour 2008th Sun to Earth took place on 31 at Sydney, Australia at 19.30 local time.
 [Edit] Measurement of the reduction in use of electricity for Earth Hour is known for its results in decreased energy consumption. But no power is not reported on the reduced energy production. This is statistically associated with zero effect on change in carbon emissions. According to data EnergyAustralije, the local electricity supplier, power consumption during the events 2007th in Sydney was 10.2% lower during the Hour than would be expected for this time, weather conditions and patterns of consumption of the previous four years. Herald Sun equated this with &quot;removing 48,613 cars off the road during the 1 hour&quot; [59]. Criticism among the most famous one columnist Andrew Bolt marked the event as a &quot;cutting is so tiny that it is trivial - equal to removing six cars off the road for one year&quot; [60]. Put in context, six cars as the removal of six cars off the road at any time during the day or night.
 In response to this criticism the organizers of Earth Hour responded that &quot;if the greenhouse reduction achieved in the Sydney CBD during Earth Hour is a viable one year, will be equivalent to removing 48,616 cars off the road during the year&quot; [61] and further that the main goal of Earth Hour to create awareness about climate change and &quot;to express that individual action on a mass scale can help change our planet for the better&quot; [61] and not only require specific energy reduction made during the hour. Figure of 10.2% was challenged David Solomon, a finance student at the University of Chicago. Without citing sources or analytical method that claims to be used, Solomon says that he used eight years of data on the use of electricity to conclude that the decline Satom inspired by the planet Earth was 6.33% and when you take out other potential factors in the calculation result is 2 , 10% as &quot;indiscriminate statistically from zero&quot; [59].
 In some areas of the northern hemisphere will sunset in 20 hours, which will remove some of the benefits of this event [62].
