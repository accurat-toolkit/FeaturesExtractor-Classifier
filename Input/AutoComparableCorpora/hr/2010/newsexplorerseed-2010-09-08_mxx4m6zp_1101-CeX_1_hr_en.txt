She called on its members, but also other Christians, to publicly burned a copy of the Islamic holy book. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that it would be idiotic and dangerous. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also objected to the idea, calling it shameful. The intention has caused outrage in the U.S. and condemnation of all religious leaders. His concerns the consequences of burning the Koran and the anger that would cause the Islamic world and expressed the NATO commander of international forces in Afghanistan General David Petraeus.
 It is an act that could endanger not only the lives of American soldiers but also civilians, and not just in the Arab world. However, despite the ban city governments, as well as numerous death threats, the pastor of a fundamentalist Christian community in Florida Terry Jones and his 50-odd followers do not give up.
