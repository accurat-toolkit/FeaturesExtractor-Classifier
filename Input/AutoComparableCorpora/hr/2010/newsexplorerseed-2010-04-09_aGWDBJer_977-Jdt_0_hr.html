And Mason-Dixon poll has Blanche Lincoln leading Bill Halter by 12 points. </em></p>
<p style="CLEAR: both"><strong>From Chuck Todd, Mark Murray, Domenico Montanaro, and Ali Weinberg</strong> <br />*** <strong>No Surprise Obama:</strong> Move over "No Drama Obama." Is it now time for "No Surprise Obama"? President Obama's selection of U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan to serve on the Supreme Court, which was first reported by NBC's Pete Williams last night, is at least the third time Obama has unsurprisingly picked the overwhelming front-runner -- joining his pick of Joe Biden as his VP in '08 and his SCOTUS selection of Sonia Sotomayor in '09. (Contrast those picks with Bush's surprising selections of Dick Cheney and Harriet Miers, as well as John McCain's incredibly surprising choice of Palin as his VP pick.)  Obama and his team usually telegraph their selections, allowing the media, interest groups, and even the opposition to kick the tires. The only one big Obama surprise on the nomination front? Hillary Clinton for Secretary of State. Even on policy, when a shift is coming (say on the public option), this White House telegraphs like they did on these picks. The president will formally announce Kagan as his nominee to replace John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court at 10:00 am ET from the White House's East Room.</p>
<p style="CLEAR: both">*** <strong>These go to eleven: </strong>Politically, Obama may very well have chosen Kagan -- instead of, say, Diane Wood -- to avoid a drawn-out confirmation war, especially with the midterm elections less than six months from now. Seven Senate Republicans <a href="http://bit.ly/bVVCcI" target="_blank">voted for her confirmation </a>as solicitor general in 2009: Coburn (OK), Collins (ME), Gregg (NH), Hatch (UT), Kyl (AZ), Lugar (IN), Snowe (ME). When you add those seven to another four current Republicans who voted for Sotomayor -- Alexander (TN), Bond (MO), Graham (SC), and Voinovich (OH) -- you have your universe of potential GOP votes for Kagan's SCOTUS confirmation. <strong>*** UPDATE ***</strong> And it's 12 Republicans if you include Sen. Scott Brown. Yet because Kagan is confirmable, the complaint we might begin hearing from the left in the coming days is how Obama GOES OUT OF HIS WAY to avoid fights, often disappointing liberals in the process (see: option, public).</p>
<p style="CLEAR: both">*** <strong>Sestak's big gift:</strong> Interestingly, there is one Democrat who voted against Kagan's confirmation as solicitor general: Arlen Specter, who at the time was still a Republican. And with just a week before Specter's Democratic primary against Joe Sestak, the Kagan pick couldn't have come at a worse time for Specter. (Think of how easy it will be for Sestak to charge that Specter voted AGAINST President Obama's SCOTUS nominee.) By the way, Sestak is <a href="http://bit.ly/dgnd0O" target="_blank">now leading Specter by five points </a>in the latest Muhlenberg tracking poll. And what's most distressing for Specter is how his numbers really just aren't moving; he's been stuck in the low-to-mid 40s (in private polling as well) for months. Remember, diehard Democrats have been voting against Specter even when he was getting 60% support in campaigns.</p>
<p style="CLEAR: both">*** <strong>Kagan and Obama:</strong> From the get-go, Obama wanted to pick someone he believes would serve as a counterweight to Chief Justice John Roberts, which explains why the finalists (Garland, Thomas, and Wood) were all folks the president viewed as intellectual heavyweights. Both Kagan and Garland moved quickly to the top of the list because they already had experience -- both personally and professionally -- with many of the current justices. And that's something that the president himself believes is extremely important to persuade others, like swing vote Anthony Kennedy. The personal connection is big with this president. In fact, check out many of the pro-talking points about Kagan from the White House: They sound like the early talking points about candidate Obama when someone was trying to make the case he wasn't going to be your typical doctrinaire liberal. Indeed, it's a tad spooky some of the anecdotes about Kagan and conservatives at Harvard are very similar to the anecdotes we heard about Obama and conservatives during his Harvard Law days.</p>
<p style="CLEAR: both">*** <strong>Pros of the Kagan pick:</strong> In addition to what we've written above, Kagan knows the president fairly well, though they aren't personally close (while at the University of Chicago, she tried to recruit Obama, then a part-time lecturer in constitutional law, to a full-time job in academia)… A woman, she would be the court's third current female (and fourth overall), which would be a record… At age 50, she was one of the younger Supreme Court possibilities for Obama… And she brings professional diversity to the court: if confirmed, she'd be the first non-judge to be elevated to the court since 1972.</p>
<p style="CLEAR: both">*** <strong>Cons of the Kagan pick:</strong> Some liberals think that Kagan would move the Supreme Court to the right (compared with Stevens)… They argue that she -- a la Harriet Miers -- has a tiny paper trail, so they believe it's inconclusive if she's as liberal as other possible Obama picks… Liberal critics also cite Kagan's past statements that suggest she believes in strong executive-branch powers… Meanwhile, conservatives point to this: While at Harvard, she filed a friend of the court brief opposing the Solomon Amendment, which required universities that receive federal funding to be cooperative with military recruiters. Kagan contended that the military's ban on gays broke the law school's anti-discrimination policy against gays. Once the 3rd Circuit ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional, Kagan instructed Harvard Law's Office of Career Services to stop helping military recruiters. But she reversed course when the Supreme Court overturned the 3rd Circuit's decision. Still, she urged students to protest the recruiters.</p>
<p style="CLEAR: both">*** <strong>Bennett defeated:</strong> While all today's attention is on Kagan, there's another political story that's nearly as compelling -- Sen. Bob Bennett's (R) defeat at Saturday's GOP convention in Utah. For the third time in a year, Republicans essentially sent a message that one of their elected officials wasn't conservative enough for the party's nomination. But what does it say about the size of the GOP's tent that there isn't room enough for Bennett, Arlen Specter, and Charlie Crist? (We'll find out next week if there's room enough in the Dem tent for Blanche Lincoln.) What does it say for democracy when only 3,500 Utah delegates decided Bennett's fate? (Bennett, according to polls, fared much better among primary voters than these delegates.) And what kind of message does Bennett's defeat send to other GOP officials? (Who will be the next Republican who will want to team up with a Ron Wyden or any other Democrat for that matter?) Translation: Don't be surprised if Lindsey Graham is a no-show later this week when Kerry-Lieberman roll out the energy/climate bill.</p>
<p style="CLEAR: both">*** <strong>DeMint 3, McConnell 0?</strong> And if Rand Paul ends up defeating Trey Grayson in next week's GOP Senate primary in Kentucky, it would be the third Mitch McConnell-backed Senate Republican to lose this cycle or leave the party. (Bennett and Charlie Crist are the others.). DeMint never endorsed anyone in Utah, but made it clear he decided not to get involved because Bennett was an incumbent so DeMint PUBLICLY was neutral.</p>
<p style="CLEAR: both">*** <strong>Things looking brighter for the global economy?</strong> "Global markets rallied Monday, reversing the steep declines of recent days, after European leaders agreed to provide a huge rescue package of nearly $1 trillion to combat the debt crisis that has engulfed Europe, and central banks began injecting cash into the financial system," the <a href="http://nyti.ms/95pwBF" target="_blank">New York Times </a>reports. Call it Europe's TARP…. </p>
<p style="CLEAR: both">*** <strong>Super Senate Tuesday:</strong> In Arkansas, a <a href="http://bit.ly/clTxTg" target="_blank">Mason-Dixon poll</a> finds Blanche Lincoln leading Bill Halter, 44%-32% (In primaries with incumbents, their number matters A LOT more than the challenger in these polls)... After toppling Bennett in Utah, Tea Party activists are now turning their attention to the Paul-Grayson race in Kentucky, the <a href="http://bit.ly/bTmScS" target="_blank">AP </a>says… And in the Pennsylvania special congressional election to replace Jack Murtha, Democrat Mark Critz "is headed into the final 12 days of the campaign with a serious cash disadvantage," <a href="http://bit.ly/cBwj24" target="_blank">CQ </a>writes, with businessman Tim Burns, the Republican nominee, besting Critz's $73,000 cash on hand by more than four times with $308,000 in the bank.</p>

Jan Brewer (R) is up with a <a href="http://bit.ly/cXWaUS" target="_blank">Web video </a>taking umbrage at President Obama's White House Correspondents' Dinner joke about the immigration law in the state… In Florida, pollster Brad Coker, who conducted the latest Mason-Dixon poll on the Senate race there, says that Gov. Charlie Crist's current lead (38% to Marco Rubio's 32% and Kendrick Meek's 19%) is a "proverbial house of cards," the <a href="http://bit.ly/dew8nA" target="_blank">Miami Herald </a>writes… And in South Carolina, the state's Club for Growth chapter, which had been a key ally for Gov. Mark Sanford, endorsed state Rep. Nikki Haley for governor, <a href="http://bit.ly/aeTMOH" target="_blank">The State </a>reports.  </p>

<p>Have you ever watched an event unfold in front of your very eyes and thought to yourself; "How stupid can that be? What were they thinking?"  That about sums it up when I watched three term Republican Senator Bob Bennett lose at the Utah Republican Convention.</p>
<p>And why was he defeated?  "He wasn't conservative enough!"  The same words used by Republicans to pull Senator Lindsey Graham back in line.  The same words led Arlen Specter to switch parties.  The same words said to Charlie Crist to have pushed him to run as an independent. The same words that scared John McCain to run so far to the right that he supports the Arizona immigration law.  The same words are helping Rand Paul in his bid for Kentucky's Senate seat. </p>
<p>It is becoming clear that Republicans running for office are AFRAID OF THEIR OWN PARTY.  Certainly Boehner and Cantor will not speak out against Limbaugh, Beck and the Tea Party.  Ideological purity trumps pragmatism. Can being a pure conservative win elections?  I don't think so. The further right a candidate moves, the further from the middle they end up.  The Tea Party is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>
<p>Oh What A Mess: </p>
<p>It's hard enough to understand our own government, so to comment on the British government is a bit presumptive, but I'll go there anyway.  What do the Democrat Liberals want in exchange for their support in forming a majority in the British Parliament?  Proportional representation is their big issue and some say they have been fighting for it for 90 years.  It seems that the "Dem Libs" earned 23% of the vote; yet received only 9% of the seats in Parliament.  </p>
<p>They want to sweep away the Brits two-party system in favor of a multiparty system as seen in several European countries. I can't blame them for wanting fairer representations, but their current tack   could likely lead to perpetual coalition governments. When I see their mess, I keep wondering: what are they thinking? </p>
<p>It seems the voters in Pennsylvania are thinking.  Go Joe Go!! Sestak will beat Specter!<br /></p></div><div class="clearfix"><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c2613967" title="Link to this comment">#1</a> - Mon May 10, 2010 12:25 PM EDT</span></div></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment commentbody " id="c2613968"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22commentId%22%3A2613968%2C%22authorDomain%22%3Anull%7D"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal">Blindy</div></div><div id="commentText_2613968" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>*** No surprise Obama: Move over "No Drama Obama."

<p>Looking back at the age of 80, Ms. Horne said: "My identity is very clear to me now. I am a black. I'm free. I no longer have to be a 'credit.' I don't have to be a symbol to anybody; I don't have to be a first to anybody. I don't have to be an imitation of a white woman that Hollywood sort of hoped I'd become.

<p>It's amazing that the liberal press is so upset with Utah Senator Bennett being tossed aside. I guess the libs now are starting to see the true power of the Tea Party. The message from the Tea Party is that if you don't represent your constituents, you're out. And that includes Republicans. Also, getting new blood into the Senate has to be the goal. For too long we get these inside the beltway people in Congress that forget they represent their people, not themselves. Good for the Republicans to realize this and to start to replace the old Senators with the old ideas with new Senators with fresh ideas. Being a Senator is not a career position, 2 terms, tops.</p></div><div class="clearfix"><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c2613972" title="Link to this comment">#6</a> - Mon May 10, 2010 12:31 PM EDT</span></div></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment commentbody " id="c2613973"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22commentId%22%3A2613973%2C%22authorDomain%22%3Anull%7D"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal">I.R.Va.</div></div><div id="commentText_2613973" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>Good morning and good Monday to all. Please pardon for so suddenly going AWOL but that was the first and only chance I've had in the last 10 or 12 years to shrink the world down to 37 feet and only be concerned with what I may or may not do tomorrow. A little dram or two with the sunset in the evening and the company of my beautiful bride didn't hurt either. Hope all the Mothers and Grandmother's had a wonderful day and all the honors and accolades that you'll so richly deserve came your way. Happy belated birthday to Mr. Murray and hopefully you will be able to enjoy many more with good health and good company. Prayers and good thoughts to all my Tn. Friends and neighbors sure does look like you'll have had a rough time but I see by the posts that like all good mountain folks while the body had to bend a little the spirit remains unbroken. What little bit of assistance I had available at the time has already been sent but you'll be sure and let me know if there is anything else we can do. Same for the folks on the Gulf Coast. The effects down there look like they are going to be with you'll for a long time especially since nobody seems to be able to get a handle on how to shut the well down. Picked up some interesting points on my little sojourn from the Watermen from the Chesapeake to Georgia that I hope to be able to pass on later. Just like recent mining accidents this little deal points out the costs to all when a small segment is allowed to cut corners and disregard common sense precautions for the sake of profit and expediency. We should be able to do better than this at all levels both privately and governmentally and still function. I didn't even turn on a Tube machine or phone for a long time there and found that other than the mountain view from my back porch and all of you'll here ( including the hosts) I didn't miss the immediacy of the modern political process one bit. Tried to get caught up yesterday but I find that the mind just doesn't up shift as fast as it downshifts so you'll are just going to have to giggle at me for a few days until I jumpstart myself. Don't want to miss a shift and blow up what little bit I have left that would be a pure T tragedy. Might have to raid the Chicken House to get my valves adjusted. For the immediate Kagen looks like an interesting pick for the Court. More the Academian and Theorist than someone who has a long history as a practicing Judge. It will be harder to anticipate just exactly what direction she will head in but then Justice Stevens did not travel down the road that they thought he was either.  I'm sure that the debate and reactions are going to be interesting and she doesn't seem to have much backup in her so the usual mind games should get real interesting. I'm sure that in some cases it is going to look like Wyatt Earp going up against an unarmed opponent given the thought processes of some of our less lucid Legislators.</p></div><div class="clearfix"><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c2613973" title="Link to this comment">#7</a> - Mon May 10, 2010 12:31 PM EDT</span></div></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment commentbody " id="c2613974"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22commentId%22%3A2613974%2C%22authorDomain%22%3Anull%7D"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal">IMF</div></div><div id="commentText_2613974" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>The Democrats: Change we can believe in, making America the new Greece, one new entitlement, bail-out and union pay-off at a time!</p></div><div class="clearfix"><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c2613974" title="Link to this comment">#8</a> - Mon May 10, 2010 12:31 PM EDT</span></div></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment commentbody " id="c2613975"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22commentId%22%3A2613975%2C%22authorDomain%22%3Anull%7D"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal">Eric, Salinas, CA</div></div><div id="commentText_2613975" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>So President Obama is being smart and picks the frontrunners, is that a crime?  No being predictable is actually a good thing as we the people can expect what Barack will do.  Heck Obama will always be No Drama Obama when compared to the Drama Queens of the Rabid Rightwing.  Never heard such a bunch of crybaby politicians and followers as we're seeing now with the Teahadist Paliban, the Drama Queen Club for Hype.</p>

<p>I just hope they don't put a bunch of warm liquid down there and stir up the methane hydrates on the ocean floor.  BP Oil screwed up setting off a huge bubble of methane gas which is what blew the rig up.  Methane hydrates were the second great killer in the Permian die off over 200 million years ago.  Let's hope the Four Stooges don't wake a sleeping giant in their inept efforts to cap the leaking oil well.</p>
<p>It was such poetic justice that atleast 4 BP Oil executives were on the oil rig when it blew for a celebration of the rig's safety record.  Hopefully they got good and scared and will go back and make sure that BP Oil is far more careful in the future.  Instead of wasting who knows how many millions or tens of millions on lying propaganda about how safe and environmentally friendly BP Oil is they should have invested that money in actually doing the trick.</p>
<p>One oil company who is doing a great job of paying attention to detail is Exxon.  Maybe we should let Exxon take over all of BP Oil's offshore oil rigs as Exxon has done a much better job of running safe offshore oil drilling operations.</p>
<p>So funny how some of the rabid righties here were blowharding about how there weren't any big spills during Clueless George Bush's term, yet they conveniently forget the texas oil refinery fire and the big spill in Alaska as BP Oil totally forgot about doing pipe maintenance and allowed a huge section of pipe there just rot away.  Time for the rabid rightwingers to wake up and smell the reality that offshore oil drilling is inherently dangerous, especially at depths of 5,000 feet on the ocean floor.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain, all the oil and chemicals they're spewing into the ocean is going to ruin the fishing this year in the Gulf area.  It could be years before fishing resumes to normal as there will be a lot of polluted fish in the Gulf for a long time to come.  Thanks BP Oil for ruining one of our prized fishing areas with your utter lack of due diligence!</p></div><div class="clearfix"><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c2613980" title="Link to this comment">#14</a> - Mon May 10, 2010 12:38 PM EDT</span></div></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment commentbody " id="c2613981"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22commentId%22%3A2613981%2C%22authorDomain%22%3Anull%7D"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal">Josh S., WI </div></div><div id="commentText_2613981" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>*** Things looking brighter for the global economy? </p>

<br />Mark Thank You. I've been kind of AWOL the last couple of weeks so I apologize for not getting back in a more timely manner. I'm not sure that my Southernisms rise to the level of the company that you have put me in here but I do consider it a high compliment to be included with these folks. I see by your post that you are like myself and some others who followed the debate here for a while before you decided to contribute and join the community. This is something that somewhat amazes me and guess it shouldn't but I didn't realize when I joined the community here that the ripples that we send out reach as far as they do. I see where Ron and some of the others have encouraged you to join the discussion as often as you can and I would add my voice to that.  I would also encourage anybody out there who is somewhat hesitant to join the discussion to give it a try. I know that we who are more regular don't put things exactly the way you would. Put something up here and expand the thought or add a little nuance that we haven't thought of. If you don't think we're right tell us. My dear old Redneck Daddy always told me that the only fellow that was right all the time was the fellow that wasn't doing anything so we are aware that we aren't going to get it right every time. Besides that it is an opinion and the last I checked the greatest thing is that you can always express an opinion even if it only makes sense to yourself. The one thing that I really appreciate is the chance to communicate with a reasonable voice from either side of the spectrum that the community contains.  I can't and wouldn't profess to speak for all here but I appreciate any one who gives freely of their time and makes the effort to raise the level of the discussion or to clarify the points that we are trying to discuss. Thank you for the kind thoughts and I'm looking forward to adding a stop in Dallas to my daily strolls across the country.<br /></p></div><div class="clearfix"><span class="commentdate"><a href="#c2613989" title="Link to this comment">#23</a> - Mon May 10, 2010 12:50 PM EDT</span></div></div></div></div><div class="vine-p p-comment_Comment commentbody " id="c2613990"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22commentId%22%3A2613990%2C%22authorDomain%22%3Anull%7D"></div><div class="c_author"><div class="normal">pat huntington ny</div></div><div id="commentText_2613990" class="c_text"><div class="normal"><div class="commentSource"><p>Preemptive Shot from the Right-wing-nutterbutters:</p>
