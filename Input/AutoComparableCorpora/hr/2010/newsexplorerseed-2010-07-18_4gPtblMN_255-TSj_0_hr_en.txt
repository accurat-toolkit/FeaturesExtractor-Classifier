Vi≈°emilijunskog from Johannesburg in the provinces, in sparsely populated village of Buzet, moved to the bride Riki Armstrong and Brian Hagerty. While during the World Cup around the eyes of the world were fixed on South Africa, novodoseljeni Banovci not think of soccer, as they call our football. Matches are not even, say, or regularly monitored. Spend time decorating the house and six acres of derelict land and forest in the exemplary farm. - Due to rising crime, the whole family decided to move. We do not guarantee the security of any high wall around the house in a wealthy suburb of Johannesburg. In the evening it was dangerous to go out on the street. Criminals are shooting at sister&#39;s husband, and Bryan at the head placed the AK 47 and robbed him. A lot of whites are emigrating, mostly to Australia and New Zealand. We have opted for Europe. Younger sister and her husband moved to the Isle of Man. Our friends Croats working in Johannesburg, they said to come from the beautiful land of pleasant people.
 We came here and to make sure they tell the truth - says Riki Armstrong. Over the Internet have found and bought property at the end of Buzet. The village is so remote that it was no problem for the Second World War worked partisan school. Upon arrival they first had to make a new concrete bridge, garden and house, across the river Buzet, connects with the road. - I grew up on a farm. Riki is a specialist in software, but a fast learner and agriculture. For a year or two, before he turns forty years, this will be an exemplary farm with organically grown fruits and vegetables and accommodation facilities for rural tourism. We&#39;ll get married when we arrange a farm. So do not hurry too much with a job - Brian Hagerty said. Novodoseljenim Banovci time flies. Besides working on the farm, learn the Croatian language, draw, play and communicate with Internet friends. The only osnovka in the village regularly come for help with homework in English.
 In RSA, Bryan and Riki are famous musicians. Their rock band Timi for videopjesme &quot;Nameles Loser&quot; won the prize for the funniest video 2007th year.
