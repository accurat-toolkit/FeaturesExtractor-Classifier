 minutes when the &quot;Eagles&quot; lost Lukovica.Naime, Lukovic has received a second yellow karton.Prvi comes after a sharp start of one player of Ghana, and the latter due to the withdrawal of the opponent igraca.Ova two cards are still one of the rare examples of a fair trial does not only on the present, but also in all matches World Cup to sada.Clan current Champions League, Inter Milan, Dejan Stankovic, claimed in a statement after the game that first foul bulb is not a statement of such low postojao.Veoma majstora.Nedostatak bulb it is not felt in nastavku.Najprije passed the ball into the penalty area where he Krasic violently kicked in the middle of the goal, but the last hero was still keeper Richard Kingson.Par moments later, Ivanovic recorded attempt.

 SERBIA had the support of animals from gypsy ENTITY match between Ghana and Serbia played at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria in front of about 34 000 spectators. It remains a great zal as people who love football, among these 34 000 fans, have seen and the occasional animal origin from gypsy entity which cheering for the losing team of today meca.Osim this illiterate young man who is in front of the body had &quot;CCCC&quot; with Serbian flags and the background which, unfortunately, living in delusion, in the stands could be clearly seen that the image of Klagenfurt with a preliminary match of Serbia-New Zealand still prisutna.Pa so, Chetnik &quot;cockades&quot; and the flag with the skull of &quot;decorations&quot; . FIFA has its negligence in connection with this really showed how &quot;powerful&quot; in the battle that separated the two concepts - football and politics. At least the fans next to the small screen view that football is not always happy animals.
 MILOVAN RAJOVAC: SUCCESS OR FAILURE? Despite the victory of his chosen people, Ghana coach Milovan Rajevac, at any point in today&#39;s match had a smile on licu.Nije mystery, given that Rajevac originally from Serbia, with Antic had a very close odnose.To was (is) a great prijateljstvo.Ako Rajevac was supposed to tip, was tu.Ako Antic Antic is supposed to service, Rajevac was tu.Danas, Antic was supposed to win, but no (apparent) desire Rajevca for this victory could help the Serbian timu.U tunnel , before the players on the field, Rajevac not even looked at their players, while for each individual in the uniform of Serbia, rukovao.Gana today had a number of chances, but the smile on his face Rajevca, we vidjeli.Osmijeha there was not at the moment penal played, and even a few moments later, when the network zatresena.Poslije final whistle Argentine referee, Rajevac is likely headed to the locker room or the Antica, did not see it ... but it is clearly seen as brazenly shoved one of her team, when he jumped into the arms of the desire that in this way with &quot;their leader&quot; celebrate the first year pobjedu.Kuda Rajevac gone, Serbia went only points that such a game and could win.
 Whether the alliance leaders in Ghana was still what the Rajevca desire to win his team? REAL PLAYERS TALENAT Serbia to Serbia in the current team has outstanding, it should not be in sumnjati.Tu are one of the best stopper of the world, Nemanja Vidic, this is an indispensable member of the European champions Inter Milan Dejan Stankovic, there is Milos Krasic who is on the targets of numerous clubs, There is Milan Jovanovic who will soon training jersey of the famous Liverpool, there is also an experienced striker Pantelic and many others ... What is actually impacted on today &#39;s game of Serbia? One answer is in the atmosphere on the eve prenapumpanoj utakmice.Ovi players in their clubs are certainly not accustomed to journalists and supporters say they see them in the upper range competitions, which are not poceli.Oni are not accustomed to over-ambitious and over-optimistic behavior of their javnosti.Nije Mourinho precjenio Stankovic, nor Ferguson precjenio Vidic, but the Serbian public jeste.Srpska public last week published the whole as each part of the game well defined, and Ghana that Ghana does not have tajne.Utvrdjivali and that Serbia was the favorite in this match, a role in spite of the defeat was not pokazala.Sa expectations secure victory and first points on the world championship, at the end did not win anything, and there is little chance that uospte and win, because opponents have until the end of which is more difficult to nositi.To Australia and Njemacka.Za Radomir Antic, who, after the tears and joy in the victory over Romania at Marakana, last whistling Baldassija signified the beginning to change color licu.Veoma sadly, it was as rapid semafora.Iduci performance against Serbia has 18.juna in Germany Port Elizabeth, while the day after his second appearance selection of Ghana have against Australia.
