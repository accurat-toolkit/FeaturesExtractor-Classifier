Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu announced today in Tehran that Iran, Turkey and Brazil have agreed to revive a proposal, endorsed by the United Nations, to send Iran&#39;s enriched uranium abroad in exchange for nuclear fuel. &quot;The deal was reached after nearly 18 hours of negotiations,&quot; said Davutoglu. The deal could help Tehran in its dispute with the West over Iran&#39;s nuclear program, said Reuters. Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced that a deal could be officially announced tomorrow, after the presidents of Brazil and Iran, Injasio Luis Lula da Silva and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, who have now reached agreement in Tehran, consider some more details , was transferred Reuters. Turkey and Brazil have offered to mediate in finding solutions to the disputed Iranian nuclear program at a time when major powers have already discussed the introduction of the fourth set of sanctions on Iran.
 The United Nations last October offered to send Iran to Russia and France, about 1,200 pounds of its low-enriched uranium for processing into nuclear fuel for Iranian medical reactor, which Iran rejected. Iran, the world fifth biggest oil exporter, says its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes and not in the military, according to West.
