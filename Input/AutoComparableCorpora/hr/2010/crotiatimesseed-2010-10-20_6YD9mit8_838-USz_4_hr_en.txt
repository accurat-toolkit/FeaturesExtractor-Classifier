Welcome Croatian players in September, our school was visited by European gold ovjenèani Croatian players, members of the South of Dubrovnik. Our disciples were warmly received gladly, and their playfulness and imagination of children &#39;sent them a myriad of questions. Welcome, among other surprises for them, Barbara Janièiæ, disciples third C grade and Damiano Sambrailo, disciple third B grade, they read their literary works, written specially for them. Read their thoughts on one of the most successful sports in Croatia. How I learned to love polo One day Dad told me to go watch the polo. They played South and YouTube. We came to the pool in Gru ¾ in. I was very excited when I saw how many people in the stands. Everybody sang and cheered. Most liked the song: TRE, TRE, shakes ... South fought bravely, always ran and won. We were happy and satisfied we went home.
 Since I became a faithful navijaèica South and Croatian team when the wins, but when they lose.

In you I enjoy watching them while junaèki struggling in the pool, and especially happy when I score a goal. During the European Championships in Zagreb, I watched them as they fight for first place-for our Croatia! The crowd cheered them bueno and led to victory. After the last Zvi ¾ duka everything was full of celebration and great luck, because our Croatian barracuda won the gold and the top of Europe!
