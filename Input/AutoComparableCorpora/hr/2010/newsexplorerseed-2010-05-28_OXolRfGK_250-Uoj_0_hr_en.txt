Outpouring of oil in the Gulf of Mexico 2010th, also known as a discharge of oil BP, Deepwater Horizon disasters and Macondo rupture, [1] [2] [3] [4] was a massive 3-month discharge of oil into the Gulf of Mexico that occurred 20th April 2010. years and one month later the unstoppable spread of oil slicks proclaimed largest oil ecological disaster in American history, [5], which has even surpassed the catastrophic discharge of oil from the Exxon Valdez 1989th [6] [7] The cause of the eruption of oil from the seabed, which was created after the rupture and explosion of oil platforms Deepwater Horizon 20th April 2010 in the Atlantic Ocean in the vicinity of the State of Louisiana. [8] The platform was responsible for British Petroleum. [9] [10] This was the third serious incident in which he was involved with BP in the U.S. in the last five years. The eruption was launched in oil from the oil pool, which was drilled about 1.5 miles below the sea surface. Estimates on the amount of oil thrown in the sea extend 790000-16000000 liters a day. [11] As a result, polluted the sea surface of about 6.000 km2. [12] The greatest victims of disasters are fishing, tourism, marine flora and fauna and a variety of birds that have suffered severely. [13] [14] effusion was gained disrepute because the various teams over a month trying unsuccessfully to stop the eruption of oil, which caused surprise and outrage across America.
 According to the National Oceanographic Institute, in the first 40 days has expired spout is approximately 120 million gallons of oil into the sea. [15] Overall, the polluted area has been estimated at about 9.900 km2. [16] [17] From 20 April to 16 July, when he stopped a discharge of oil, estimated to have leaked into the sea in total between 500,000 and 1,000,000 tons of oil. [18] Contents [edit] Timeline [edit] Sinking oil platform Oil platform Deepwater Horizon after an explosion on an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico there was an explosion. At the time of the explosion on the platform were 126 workers, of which 17 were injured, and 11 of them died. The explosion took place 20th April 2010. about 23 hours, local time, on the well named Deepwater Horizon, located 83 km southeast of Venice, Louisiana. The Coast Guard immediately sent a helicopter from Louisiana and Alabama, and four ships to the crew evacuated and searched for the missing, however, smoke and adverse weather conditions onemogućuli their quality work. [19] Two days later, the oil platform sank.
 While on the platform of blazing fire, who unsuccessfully tried to extinguish the Coastguard boat, the sea seeped out about 8,000 barrels per day. Sinking oil platform was an unprecedented incident in the American oil industry. The platform was Transocean Ltd belonged to the company., Headquartered in Geneva, and was a corporation chartered by British Petroleum (BP). [20] [edit] discharge the collapse of oil platforms, he began a massive discharge of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. A week after the accident, the U.S. Coast Guard reported a new oil leaks and is already in less than two weeks stain reached the shore several states. The initial volume of oil that is poured into the sea was about 5,000 barrels a day, but eventually it just grew. U.S. President Barack Obama announced a major involvement of his administration and federal authorities, including the defense ministry, in a fight with a large oil slick.
 Along the coast of Louisiana is set at about nine kilometers of floating protection hose, and another 40 miles in preparation. Around one hundred thousand people worked in the repair operation, with 50 vessels and numerous aircraft, and has collected 250 000 gallons of water contaminated with oil. Engineers oil company BP announced a safety drill drains intended for setting up special funds to complete the closure of the hole, but added that it could take two to three months. [21] [edit] The fight against oil spills graph foundering and the eruption of oil platforms below the sea surface 8th May we put it so. The bell on the oil wells to stop the uncontrolled leakage of oil in the Gulf Meksičom, but must be booted due to the formation of ice crystals similar. Director of exploitation in the BP-Doug Suttles said that the solution to this problem probably need two days. Setting the steel reinforcing ring 100 tonnes of heavy extremely complex operation as it has never been performed at a depth of 1.6 kilometers. [22] After the above mentioned attempts to connect using the underwater robot, an American submarine poured the chemical ingredients for the dissolution of oil slicks.
 Assumed to be from 20 April, when the well exploded to 11 May, poured into the sea more than 13 million gallons of oil. Analysts expect the cost of remediation cost tens of billions of dollars. Oil flowing from the well, about 80 kilometers from the coast, and it is estimated that every day spilling about 800,000 gallons. [23] &quot;This causes great concern,&quot; said David Kennedy Administration from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. &quot;I&#39;m scared. This is very, very big thing. And efforts will be needed to do something, especially if the leak continues, exceeding human understanding.&quot; [24] Obama has asked Congress for emergency aid of 129 million U.S. dollars to cope with the consequences of leaving behind oil. A hundred million dollars will be allocated to the Coast Guard, and 29 million Ministry of Interior for activities (control, test) that are not in charge responsible for the pollution and the Fund for the Protection of oil spills in which oil companies pay.
 Three weeks after the start of the fight against oil slicks administration has proposed, and higher taxes for oil companies and the involvement of top scientists in the country to help British Petroleum to stop the flow of oil. [25] CEO of BP&#39;s Tony Hayward said on 25 May you never tried to mile and a half below the sea surface to stop the discharge of oil. &quot;On the surface of the earth, we could close the hole, but at this depth the chances are between 60 and 70 percent,&quot; he said. [26] Meanwhile, a month after the spills, polluted more than 100 kilometers of coastline and the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal has threatened that the federal government to take matters into their own hands, listing requests sent by BP and the Coast Guard for a floating barrier and other equipment. 26th May shot is injected into oil wells in the so-called &quot;top kill&quot; methods, in order to stop leakage of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, according to the BP, which points out that the final result is known only for 48 hours. [27] This is the first time that the method used the sea at a depth of 1,500 meters. [28] [29] However, this did not stop leaking oil into the sea.
 Same this disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is already resentment occurred at almost the same way 30 years ago. United Mexican company Pemex in June 1979. worked on the 3-km deep borehole, when technical problems occurred due to a strong explosion. For the next 9 months, experts have tried unsuccessfully to stop the leakage of oil by the same methods used today. Spilled 3 million barrels of crude oil, Pemex has been on a rescue and cleaning spent about 100 million U.S. dollars. [30] [edit] Temporary closure of 15th July 2010, after nearly three months of constant discharge of oil, BP said it has successfully stopped outlet, with the help of capsule weight of 75 tons and a height of 10 meters, connected to the preventer failed. But this is only a temporary solution. [31] [32] President Barack Obama has carefully received the news about stopping spills, and diplomatically said that we should wait some time before the euphoria.
 [33] Valves capsules are temporarily opened to allow seismic testing to determine that no oil escaped below the bedrock. [31] By this temporary stopping spills, oil is almost constantly dripping into the sea 85 days since the catastrophic explosion on oil platform 20th April. [31] By 19 July, were not found any indication that the wells themselves cracked therefore capsule has fulfilled its purpose. [33] [34] Thad Allen, a retired U.S. Coast Guard admiral in charge of the operation, stopping the spill, said that the capsules used to divert leakage of oil to the ships on the surface to collect the same, enabling the temporary closure buštoine during storms, rather than permanent closing wells. [34] [edit] Permanent closure of BP in May, began to drill two wells for secondary removal of pressure from the first, so it would be blocked. Once the minor reaches the original wells, the operator will release the mixture into the original hole.
 [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] According to estimates, additional wells will go into operation in August 2010. [41] and will cost approximately $ 100 million apiece. [42] [43] [edit] The consequences of dirty oil Pelican Rescue Centre Rescue wash oil from feathers of pelicans in the three states fishermen have lost their income. Migratory birds that nest on small islands at the confluence of the Mississippi were mass casualties. Oyster farms were closed. Fish that spawn at the confluence of the others are no younger, because the eggs that float to the surface of the water, along with the plankton, were the first victims, and for them the whole food chain. Turtles, fish and birds have generally been the greatest victims of environmental disasters. Samantha Joye of the University of Georgia has expressed concern that it will take years and perhaps decades to restore the ecosystem as a result of pollution by oil and gas. [44] This is in contrast with the position Director of BP&#39;s Tony Hayward, who stated that the outpouring oil have a &quot;very, very slight effect on the environment.&quot; [45] Steve Ross of the University of North Carolina said that the coral reef to the east of America is probably damaged. [46] 29
 April Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal issued a state of emergency after the news that the oil splash to the coast of the state. [47] as early as next week, the first signs of pollution have become visible on the coast. [48] Fishing has been banned temporarily in this period. [49 ] The federal government is 24 May proclaimed &quot;fish catastrophe&quot; for the following states: Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. [50] As regards the economic cost, the damage is difficult to procjenjiva. Some experts argue that the costs and needs to be cleaned coast, twice when they are just more expensive oil in the water. Some estimates suggest that for this ecological catastrophe BP had set aside up to 3 billion U.S. dollars. [51] Others suggest that the price was $ 4.6 billion. [52] 25 May, BP has informed the public that he has spent $ 760 million in the remediation of spills. This price in turn increased $ 10,000,000 a day. [53] 30 April, Merrill Lynch reported that the five companies associated with the incident - BP, Transocean, Anadarko Petroleum, Halliburton and Cameron International Corporation - lost a total of $ 21 billion in capital marketed. [54] According to UBS, the final calculations could be up to $ 12 billion.
 The Guardian published an article analyzing the standard state penalty $ 1,100 per barrel of oil spilled, but in the case of gross negligence and climbs up to $ 4,300 per barrel. In the worst scenario, estimates of the leakage svakodenvnom (115,000 barrels) multiplied by two months required for recovery could result in up to $ 60 billion cost. [55] In the United States are more often heard comparisons of oil spills from Hurricane Katrina in 2006 . in September flooded New Orleans. On this occasion, killed 1,800 people and anger the population, due to the extremely slow response of government and neinteresa which was a disaster and suffering at the time showed President George W. Bush, soon spilled all over the country and brought the first Democrat to win election to Congress, and then and Barack Obama to victory in the elections. That&#39;s why the White House rejects any such comparison, but the political damage was done. [56] On the eve of his 26th visit to the Gulf of Mexico
 May, Obama told BP in the &quot;already clogged the damn hole.&quot; [57] Obama has also ordered that until further notice will not issue permits for drilling at great depths. &quot;I know it can not diminish the enormous anger and frustration caused by this disaster in the population of the Gulf of Mexico and many Americans,&quot; he said and announced that it moves in a furious showdown with corruption in the oil industry which, he admits, should have addressed earlier.
