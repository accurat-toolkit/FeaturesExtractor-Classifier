The state is a bad investor, you want to forward, Croatia its development must be based on private investment - is one of the most highly attended conference conclusions of the Business news and magazines Bank about the new model of growth of the Croatian economy. Organizers of the event all day at the hearing together political, economic and scientific elite, a set of conclusions arising from exposure to a number of speakers: the American ambassador to Croatia, James B. Foley, through the World Bank&#39;s chief economist, university professor Ivo Bicanic, to independent analysts and government advisers. Two major projects meeting was opened by Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor in recent days often call for government investment projects, which it intends to increase the growth rate was estimated at 14 billion euros. - And now I have two folder with the two big deals in the energy sector. When a project is good, no one should be afraid to make a decision - she was prime minister, probably as a response to the remarks of U.S. Ambassador Foley is a group of American investors waited five years for an answer about the property disputes to one of its tourist project.
 They waited and gave up, and Croatia has lost several hundred million euros private investment. - The current model of development in Croatia is not sustainable. Now I see more important things for the future of the country from a change in economic models that will also help to create jobs and employ workers - was unusually open to Foley. Economic think the country does not share the Government&#39;s optimism when it comes to investments. - It&#39;s not our problem rate of investment but that these investments bring bad results - said Dr. Ivo Bicanic, a professor at the Zagreb Faculty of Economics, which showed that in the short term state projects bring about the increase in GDP, but in the long run lead to negative growth. - Investments in roads are not modified in the future, it&#39;s just a way for politicians to stay in the BMW and be re-elected to power - said Dr. Bicanic and warned that Croatia has no time for waiting and fruitless debate.
 - We have only three to a maximum of six months to train a new jump in Europe - said Bicanic and urged to move with the shock-therapy. It is interesting that these terms are used and Kosor advisor Borislav Wilkes, who is also returning to the past to warn that the surplus of workers in the public sector, the age-old problem. As an absolute advocate of privatization, Wilkes said that she was one of the solutions. He agreed with him and Velimir weaklings from Arhivanalitika saying that the Croatian problem that has started to build capitalism without capitalists, and developed markets. Referring to the research, weaklings claims that at least 50 percent growth in Croatia dictated trends in the EU, but the problem is that it is a bad use its capabilities. Be submitted to the victims - Croatia is a country of investment fascination, constantly looking for big projects and the dominant role of government - said Sonja. For it is warned and the World Bank&#39;s chief economist Sanjay Madžarević-Šujster saying that the country must use its reserves (such as employment, productivity, innovation), but does not jeopardize macroeconomic stability and exchange rate.
 - Croatia has a rigid labor market and it is a fact about which to speak. From benign problems such as the definition of working time to release the costs that are among the largest in Europe, but globally - she is S. Madžarević-Šujster. The problem is the mismatch between the qualifications of employees, on the one hand, 300 000 unemployed, and every month, companies are looking for 50,000 workers and can not find them. - Long-term, it is the most dangerous segment that will lead to stagnation of the economy - underlined by S. Madžarević-Šujster ended his remarks a note that they sometimes need to submit short-term sacrifices for long-term benefits. I second the Kosor advisor, Zeljko Lovrinčević, color of state interventionism. - All countries should ensure a stable public finances - he said. The business daily and monthly bank believe that the change nepoduzetničke climate in Croatia is possible, and therefore initiated a joint project of the Business Forum and over the next six months to a year a series of investigations, analysis, conferences, roundtables, public lectures and discussions, with the support Vecernji rate and 24-hour, open debate on a new economic model.
 Ivo Bicanic: long sorry history of failure We have a long history of failure to reform, the 50-ies of the last century, we have attempted to implement several reforms, and none failed. Will not this one. We need shock therapy, not a debate at length. Shock would say was that Governor Rohatinski says will no longer defend the exchange rate. Zeljko Lovrinčević: Consensus only alibi biggest costs make the public sector and public enterprises with their inefficiency, attempt a consensus with all of it is often an alibi. The responsibility is on the Government to take the risk. The new growth model should be based on exports and entrepreneurial initiative, but no product. Borislav Wilkes: The Coalition is a burden for a new growth model requires a shock. We have become hostages of the dominant public opinion of the electorate. I would change the electoral law, I would try to knock down smaller interest groups that paralyze politicians. Winning the structure should be freed interests of coalition partners.
