After several encounters with civilians who are not like Americans because they distort the image, the two largest private companies in Afghanistan za≈°titatrske, Watan Risk Management and Security Compass, got fired and no longer protected the numerous truck convoys supplying NATO bases. Evil tongues say that the security company had a lucrative deal with the Taliban - the money they received for the job of protecting the convoy, in part to &quot;podmazali palms,&quot; the leaders of the Taliban not to attack the convoys. Morally dubious, but certainly effective. 14th May, the first day of a ban on activities of Watan and the Compass, at 10.30 in the morning attacked a convoy. The attacks that followed for two weeks blocked about 1000 trucks, and the Afghan authorities had Watan Cvompassu and give yourself permission to start playing again in his work. There is an ongoing investigation into the alleged bribing of the Taliban, but all to appear as concrete evidence of that, the convoy still have to drive a little what this can do.
 American program &quot;Host Nation Trucking&quot; gives contracts to 2.2 billion national transportation company, and are expected to cope with their own insurance. - We finance both sides - said one NATO official in Kabul on condition of anonymity. Recently, most of the security agencies came under the control of walija Ahmed Karzai, the brother of the president and the literal master of Kandahar, which is accused not only of corruption, but also for the opium trade. How things will develop further with the billions that Americans stand for the safe transportation, whether they &quot;skip the intermediaries&quot; and negotiate directly with the Taliban, or to continue paying dearly every instance in a chain arrangement, we will see.
