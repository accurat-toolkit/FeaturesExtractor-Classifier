&quot;The sentence does not mean anything to me,&quot; he said, warning that Americans did not understand the plight of his fellow Muslims. &quot;Brace yourself, because the war has just begun.&quot; Two days after the botched bombing effort on May 1, Shahzad was arrested at JFK International Airport as he attempted to flee the United States for the Middle East. He immediately cooperated with investigators and soon pleaded guilty to 10 counts, including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and an attempt to kill or maim. Shahzad has shown no remorse during court appearances and apparently told investigators he had hoped to pull off a second bombing two weeks after the Times Square attack and after that as many as he could until he was captured or killed. He said he acted alone out of anger about U.S. military action in Muslim Countries and mistreatment of Muslims around the world. Yet others allegedly associated with his terrorism efforts were also arrested in the United States and Pakistan as evidence emerged that the Pakistani Taliban was backing Shahzad both with cash and advice.
 The son of a retired Pakistani air force marshal, Shahzad grew up in a mostly secular upper-middle-class neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan&#39;s largest city. He first came to the United States as a teenager in 1998 to study and, over the years, attained some of the trappings of what many in the United States consider a successful life - two university degrees, a wife and two small children, a house in the suburbs, a job as a junior financial analyst, credit cards and an SUV.
