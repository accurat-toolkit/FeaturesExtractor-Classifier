This global crusade antidžihadskoj-Zionist campaign was joined by many ignorant, naive and deceived the Muslims, but also those others, which are attributed to Islamic knowledge. Arab media in the service of its regime constantly repeated story about the &quot;evil Muslim terrorists who are a threat not only to the West, but also by Muslims in Muslim countries (read: Arab regimes). Since the regime engaged people with Islamic knowledge to young people to warn of the &quot;modern movement haridžizma&quot; as they call the global jihadist movement. Last weekend, the Somali capital of Mogadishu was the scene of a bloody terrorist act that killed or wounded at least 100 people. Epithet terrorist reinforced by the fact that the attack was carried out on a place of worship - a mosque, and that they were killed or wounded in the mosque and were waiting for the midday prayer (salat). This attack was in fact the realization of the assumptions of leadership al-Šebaba, Somali džihadskog movement, which is still in January this year, warned that U.S. private companies like Blekvotera (Black Water) are planning to carry out terrorist attacks on mosques and markets in Somaliji1, with common goals and the same pattern in which they performed acts of terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
 The system operation of these companies is practically worked out in Iraq imply bombs in mosques, markets, busy streets, and then for such terrorist acts and blame the Mujahideen to discredit them in the eyes of local people to what they ceased to provide support and assistance. Professionals from these American companies are well-terrorist effort is that these attacks look like &quot;suicide bombings of Islamic terrorists.&quot; Dirty strategy to have this opportunity to use the devastating planting explosives under the car of fighters who are known among local residents as members of the Movement of the Mujahideen. Then the crusade criminals detonated his explosives at a time when the car was found among the people, often near mosques or markets. So the ignorant Muslims removed doubts that the mujahid conducted suicide attacks on other Muslims. As the Mujahideen have no other job than to kill innocent people, and being a Muslim! Such attacks would be followed by the global, crusade-Zionist, and local, underling the media, declaring them as &quot;suicide attacks of Islamic terrorists.&quot;
 This scenario was repeated quite often in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Last year Pakistan had been the scene of such bloody attacks. Criminal U.S. companies are not chosen as the means to achieve its tasks: from mosques across the Islamic University in Islamabad until the orders for food in refugee camps in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Muslims were killed, and blamed for terrorist attacks Mujahideen. Thus, among the Muslims spread a negative image of the Mujahideen, in fact the terrorists who kill innocent Muslims. This global crusade antidžihadskoj-Zionist campaign was joined by many ignorant, naive and deceived the Muslims, but also those others, which are attributed to Islamic knowledge. Arab media in the service of its regime constantly repeated story about the &quot;evil Muslim terrorists who are a threat not only to the West, but also by Muslims in Muslim countries (read: Arab regimes).
 Since the regime engaged people with Islamic knowledge to young people to warn of the &quot;modern movement haridžizma&quot; as they call the global jihadist movement. Thus, by both of these people Muslims repeat the same rhetoric that to this day &quot;spin&quot; on a global Zionist-crusaders media: that today there is no legitimate džihadskog movement and how these Mujahideen are in fact terrorists, or fools, or &quot;haridžije. Terrorists because they were so named Obama crusade-Zionist media, and a must these &quot;scholars&quot; as to require their &quot;Islamic rulers&quot; who are most ordinary puppets of America and the West. Haridžijama call them because I do not want to believe in fairy tales that the Islamic youth of sleep, and that is that the tyrannical, tagutski and puppet Arab regimes legitimate Islamic government that a Muslim can not even mildly criticize, let alone zanegirati their right to power. The voice of this group of missionaries regime, especially those from the so-called.
 Saudi Arabia, rang out to the furthest Muslim sites. Bosnia and Herzegovina was no exception. So many of the BH &quot;Islamic intellectuals,&quot; especially those who are on the payroll so. The Saudi government, meet the global krstaškoj-Zionist campaign in the fight against Islamic &quot;terrorists&quot;. On several occasions, in lectures, as they do on their electronic and print media, these BH &quot;Islamic intellectuals,&quot; defending the sacred goals of whole-media crusade, warning of the deleterious effects of modern jihad movement, or as they call it, extremist, terrorist or haridžijskog (tekfirskog) movement. Thus, these Mujahideen media repeatedly called fools, haridžijama, terrorists who kill Muslims. That the authors of such serious accusations against the best creation of Allah wanted to check out the news that sold the world mass media, from whose sources are supplied, they could do with a few mouse moves electronically.
 There has not been a single terrorist act in which Muslims were killed and that the global or local leaders of the mujahideen are following statement: that behind such attacks are not the Mujahideen, and that the Mujahideen went into battle to protect Muslims, not to kill them. To make matters worse, the authors mentioned above bh &quot;Islamic&quot; media have accused the Mujahideen to kill children and the allocation of Bajram packages! As the Mujahideen have no other job but to kill children for Eid! We would not be surprised that those who manipulate religion, at the same time pointing out the manipulation of religion (remember the article &quot;Manipulating the faith&quot;), tomorrow, published an article stating that the Mujahideen are eaten alive by a Muslim child for breakfast, and two child dinner. Of course, they will say the terrorists and not Mujahideen, because it is a &quot;mujahid&quot; dangerous and could make it to insult the disbelievers who are so persistently justified. Placing such embarrassing statements, the said &quot;Islamic intellectuals,&quot; have achieved two dunjalučla &quot;good&quot;: The first is that they ensure their status (and tangible benefits) for their superiors.
 Second, even more &quot;good&quot; is that they finally justify the kafirskim authorities, because they wear beards, just like the &quot;terrorists&quot; to that prompt. Finally, the insults against the Mujahideen have shown the world that they are not &quot;Islamic terrorists&quot; and that, even fighting against &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot; and the manipulation of religion. So they &quot;ensure&quot; a peaceful worldly life and become honest advisers anti-Islamic government modeled on those that they follow the &quot;famous and recognized scholars. Thus, sebebi these &quot;Islamic intellectuals,&quot; acts of terrorism crusade company attributed to the Mujahideen, and many Muslims are disappointed in the movement of jihad, because the word &quot;Islamic intellectuals,&quot; have penetrated where the mass media could not. To return to the crusaders&#39; military companies years ago has conducted terrorist attacks around the war zone of the Muslim world, from Iraq to Pakistan. However, this is the first time something like this happened in Somalia.
 Somalia is now the turn of weakness of the Somali transitional government formed by America and the West, as well as a huge support to Somali people mudžahidskom movement, concerned leaders of global terrorism - America and the West. Not even hundreds of millions of dollars in aid money and weapons did not help the transitional government and the Sufi movement in Somalia to oppose the Mujahideen. In the war against the Mujahideen did not help either crusade participation of thousands of troops from Uganda and Burundi, composed of troops of the African Union AMIS mission. It turned out that the Alliance cruiser, Sufis, murdžija and secularists is not sufficient to create a counterbalance Mujahideen. In such a situation, Sharif Ahmed, chairman Somali transitional government, launched a tour of East and West (last year). Since the West has sought help in money, troops and weapons training. But, what is sought from the East? From the East, specifically the so-called. Saudi Arabia, called for a &quot;imanski opium&quot; - fatwas zabludjelih royal scholars who will give him a legitimate challenge the legitimacy of the Mujahideen, calling them various names such as &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;haridžija&quot;, just as they did with the jihadist movement in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
 Ahmed Sheriff&#39;s royal ulema came to meet - fatwa was given, but, much to the chagrin of Ahmed Sheriff, freedom-loving and proud of the Somali people are not looked at these fatwas &quot;known and recognized scholars. Thus, Ahmed Sharif, former president of the movement mudžahidskog Union of Islamic Courts (before Ethiopian occupation of Somalia, 2006). And I became a victim of their conspiracy and an experimental rat &quot;failed experiment, the regime of Saudi scholars. So all the advantages of Ahmed serif &quot;wasted&quot;, and there was no end of grief. How is the duty of allies to assist the other party in the alliance, the U.S. government rush to help their slaves from the Somali transitional government and runs the bloody terrorist attacks on Muslim civilians. The first of these attacks in the new series Crusader terrorism was the bombing of a mosque in Mogadishu on Saturday, 1 May 2010.2 Senior official al-Šebab Islamic movement, Sheikh Fuad Muhammad Halaf, for this attack which was last weekend killed and wounded at least 100 Muslims accused the U.S. security company Xe (formerly Black Water), which is located at the airport in Mogadishu.
 Sheikh Fuad categorically accused Somalia&#39;s transitional government for helping Xe in the commission of this act. Islamic leaders said the Americans and their allies do not want to allow the realization of an Islamic state in Somalia. &quot;We want to establish Islamic Sharia in the country and we will not stop (from Jihad) until you achieve this goal,&quot; he said before hundreds of his followers in Mogadišuu.3 If we take into account the statements of high officials and al-Šebaba text that follows become clearer that many facts were hidden from the eyes of Muslims, or distorted by the &quot;Islamic intellectuals.&quot; The founder of Xe, the biggest U.S. terrorist mercenary company, Erik Prince, devout Catholic educated in the Dutch Christian school in Michigan, SAD.4 among their staff in the Xe-in, Prince is known as High profile Islamophobia who believes that his life mission is to contribute to the destruction of the Muslim population on the planet in what was described as part of a global campaign of genocide or &quot;crusade&quot; .5 Two former employees were accused Xe-a/Black Water Erik Prince wants to initiate a global religious crusade against Muslims.
 In the affidavit given to court in Virginia, one of the witnesses said that the Prince, &quot;sees itself as cruiser with the task of eliminating Muslims and Islam from the earth,&quot; and saying that he personally &quot;advocated the destruction of life and rewarded in Iraq,&quot; .6 &quot;The prince intentionally sent to Iraq some people who shared his vision of Christian superiority, that these people wanting to take advantage of every possible opportunity to kill Iraqis, &quot;said one of the witnesses under oath. He also added that going into Iraq, among like-minded Princovim seen as a sport or igra.7 Erik Prince and his executors did not stay away from their &quot;sacred&quot; mission on which the name speaks for itself that are entered can - Xe - whose first letter &quot;X&quot; (from the Greek alphabet) and the cross symbolizes Christianity. Moreover, many agents of these companies are cruising in their missions instead of using the names sound codes taken from the medieval order of Crusader knights templar, knights who fought the crusaders ratovima.8 Put believers Footnote: 1
