Afghan President Hamid Karzai summoned the Taliban to lay down their weapons in exchange for jobs and money to the foundation of his peace plan which would be financed with money the international community and with the support of major powers, Karzai said on Friday the BBC. The United States and Great Britain will support such a scheme of peace at the international conference on Afghanistan next week in London, he found the president in an interview. Japan has also shown a willingness to fund such a peace plan. Its volunteers, mostly ordinary peasants, the Taliban are paying to participate in the rebellion sums much larger than that paid the Afghan government can pay for their security forces. The government in Kabul is weak compared to the war leaders who have the money, equipment, power, financed by opium production. The Afghan government, however, is subject to severe criticism because of the omnipresent corruption, but Karzai has recently been very strongly rejected the accusations of the UN agencies that nearly a quarter of Afghanistan&#39;s GDP swallowed corruption.
 For the BBC Karzai said the Afghan people must get peace at any price war, and instead must begin to build reconciliation. Western powers initially did not support the financing plan of reconciliation with the Taliban, but later accepted it. Karzai is expected that, if it manages to be agreed next week at a conference in London for five years be able to independently run their own country. (REUTERS / metro-portal)
