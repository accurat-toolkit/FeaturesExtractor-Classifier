Rewards for loyalty-intention is to keep the Croatian sailors on our boats and adequately reward them for their loyalty. Additionally, we, along with &quot;seniority bonus and salary increase officers&#39; staff by ten percent. Also, we have shortened the contracts for officers from six to four months on board, so we have the salary and length of stay on the boat reached the top among the Croatian ship operators, as well as international standards on ships for transport of bulk and heavy cargoes. This local mariners offer the same or even better conditions for local company in comparison with foreign, Banovic said. For officers of the Atlantic voyage was introduced and one-time awards for years of sailing on their ships in the form of &quot;loyalty bonus&quot;. This is a bonus, said Banovic, an integral part of their wages, but it accumulates until the expiry of the contract which is signed by each officer and then once paid in full. -So, for example, the master, who was signed for five years, after this time, unless interrupted work in Atlsntskoj &quot;and if your job was done on a professional way, without serious incidents caused by their actions, to be paid 15 and a half thousand euros.
 If you sign on the seven and a half years they will be paid 25 000 euro, and after ten years of 36 000 euros. In case of change of occupation, for example, if the seafarer five years was the first officer, and then another five years of service as the commander of our ships, so will his bonus be paid as if all the ten years he was commander, going up to what is better for the sailor said Banovic. Seven newly Atlantic voyage will over the next two years to increase its fleet of seven new buildings, which will average age of the fleet from the current less than eight years fall into all four years. It is considered Gynecology, an additional asset for attracting and retaining the Croatian fleet sailors on an equal, and it is obvious that the &quot;Atlantic&quot; will find that only the new ships, no well-established and experienced crew, will be sufficient to achieve the desired results. As has always been so and today was the main motive for doing business seamanship, good seaman is difficult to attract and even harder to keep in competition with many foreign companies, if they do not offer adequate remuneration.

I am confident that the new, higher income to &quot;Atlantic&quot; and for them to be attractive, says Banovic. That the &quot;Atlantic&quot; seriously working on training and retaining their own personnel by the fact that in twelve of the total of nineteen ships of their fleet currently flies seven p.m. even deck cadets and eighteen engineering interns. Veteran non-boarding the vessels for heavy cargo and vessels in coastal trade, but because ukrvacamo over the other. We hope that most of them remain in our company because it is always better to have your own people, that you have raised, Banovic said, adding that it is itself the cadets to master, and later director profesinalnu entire career spent just on the Atlantic voyage .
