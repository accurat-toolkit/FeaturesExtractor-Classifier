This year&#39;s Grammy awards were marked by the women with their spectacular performances and the number of awards and a tribute to the late Michael Jackson, whose lifetime achievement award over his children. Sensational performances had Beyonce, Pink (which is like circus acrobats down the screen), and Lady Gaga who performed an impressive duet with Elton John during which they both played the piano, facing each other. Many had expected a bright, colorful dance performance by this duo, but the performance on the piano was surprisingly good. But the solo performance by Lady Gage was in her style. Dressed in extravagant, glittering, green bikini, the singer performed his hit single &quot;Poker Face&quot; with a carefully planned dance routine and using pyrotechnics. The winner of the night was Beyonce who returned home with six gold gramophones. Lady Gaga has won in the category of songs, with their &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;.

Their recording of &quot;Use Somebody&quot; was not a favorite, because many thought it would be three main categories divided between the three main &quot;ladies&#39; night: Beyonce, Lady GaGa and Taylor Swift.&quot; Few are drunk, but we happy drunks, &quot;said frontman when downloading awards. Veseli rockers have received two awards for best rock song and rock collaboration.
