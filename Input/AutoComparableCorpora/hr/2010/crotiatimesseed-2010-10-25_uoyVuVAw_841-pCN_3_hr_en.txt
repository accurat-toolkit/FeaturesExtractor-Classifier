Even before the beginning of the discussion fell heavy statement. Representative Gordana Sobol warned failure to comply with the agreed order of presentation. &#39;I want to express outrage. Last week I applied for a speech and I was informed that I was first in line. Now I see that I&#39;m the third. I know that nothing will change, but I think the red that we know, &quot;said Sobol. The Speaker of Parliament, Luka Bebic, after her remarks did not change the schedule of exposure, and only said he would check on the matter. Zoran Milanovic is on behalf of the applicant&#39;s debate on confidence the government said it would refrain from insults, not to offend anyone, but that certainly will refrain from evidence. He recalled that a motion of no confidence submitted to the Government on three grounds. &quot;We ask a question of trust because we believe that the government was responsible for the bad economic situation, for not implementing the necessary reforms in the country, and most importantly, this government has lost all political and moral credibility,&quot; Milanovic said.
 Head of the opposition has repeatedly reiterated that Croatia was a hostage to internal party conflicts within the HDZ. &#39;We&#39;ll all day, you will be glad to listen, but you will not silence us. Do you have all the power to listen to? Do not traumatize Croatia, she was in an unenviable situation due to the dynastic conflicts of the HDZ. It is time that this country leads to honest government, &#39;said Milanovic. Bebic Milanovic repeatedly warned it has violated the Prime Minister and the Government because he said that it a shame for Croatia and that no moral credibility. &#39;Advocate for decent vocabulary in Parliament, &quot;said Bebic. He added that the reported 29 Milanovic speech correction incorrect allegations. The number of replicas could be heard &#39;refined&#39; folk sayings such as &quot;Okos bokoš ... hen do something &#39;and&#39; not nice when a cat western calfskin head. &quot; Milanovic briefly left the Parliament chamber, as lawmakers take advantage of the replicas and told him that if he is already hurt the groin will then be able to sit in government.
 &gt;&gt; &quot;Court party declared prime minister found guilty of three counts of &#39;&gt;&gt; VIDEO: Kosor not want to be called&#39; party boss&#39;&gt;&gt; PHOTO: SDP Leader: This Government is a shame for Croatia Ivo Sanader was present, but went on to the parliamentary debate came and former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and a few moments after his successor Kosor. For a discussion is not reported to, and the question of whether to do it he said &#39;we&#39;ll see. &quot; However, he left the Parliament chamber after an hour. Kosor in his speech referred to Milanovic&#39;s speech and said that the Government&#39;s response očtivanje, not defense. &#39;This is not a court, but the parliament. We have provided reasoned response, and one of the arguments is the report II of the action plan for economic recovery, &quot;said Kosor. The Prime Minister also looked back at allegations that the Government of Croatia in disgrace. &quot;Obama is certainly not meant to shame for Croatia. That certainly does not think that other presidents and prime ministers with whom I met, from Obama to Putin, &quot;she said.
 In my humble opinion, I think a good lead by Parliament. I&#39;ll take any help because I was so brought up, &quot;said Bebić Kosor has rejected a request to the Government a vote of confidence, saying that the SDP will be on the Government to decide the election, which will be welcomed with pride. After premijerkinog speech was followed by a series of corrections of inaccurate statements and reports of injuries among the representatives of Procedure, which complained to Vice President of the Parliament. &#39;Vladimir Seks disturb the order at the meeting, &quot;said Representative Ostojic. Bebić: So I was brought up in childhood &#39;Solve your problems with each other. Unable to Deputy Speaker constantly intervenes. It was sabotage, &quot;Milanovic said. Bebic was sent to a presidency because surrender sex. &quot;Every member has the right to raise the table. When will I chaired, I decide to. I, in my humble opinion, I think correctly lead the parliament. Had my dignity called into question I&#39;d like to know.
 I did not feel that I teach. I do so I do not see any and I&#39;ll accept the help. So I simply brought up in childhood, &quot;said Bebic. In a series of replies to your comment Kosor speech was given by the representative Dragutin Lesar. &#39;You said at the end of&#39; All for Croatia &#39;. Mrs. Kosor, you do not have to give all of Croatia, is enough to resign, &quot;said Lesar. In zahuktaloj debate emerged and a &#39;supernatural suggestion&#39; representative Boris Kunst. &#39;Let the prime minister declared one minister, the minister for extraterrestrials, &quot;he said, referring to the statement of MP Ingrid Anticevic Marinovic correction of inaccurate statements during the Prime Minister Kosor. At a time when the speaker&#39;s turn came Milanovic, Seks Bebićevo took place at the head of Parliament and the students who went to the gallery in parliament waving and sexy and Milanovic could not agree on where the greeting was sent. Also, &#39;worshiped&#39; and the awarding doctorates while Milanovic said that he, unfortunately, can not give you a doctorate in law given that it is not finished, and sex to him is owed.
 &#39;I can not assign you a doctorate from any one area, because you have no prerequisites for this. &quot; &#39;Stazić lie to me lie that the PM lied&#39; Damien Cain spoke in the first debate clubs in the name of the IDS. &#39;It makes no sense to look for confidence, because this government has no confidence and no sense to look for something that does not exist. I think the most responsible for this situation, two prime ministers, former and current. And if it is not an inter-war, which denies it, then I do not know what it is, &quot;he said. Cain mentioned the arrival of Pope Benedict XVI in Croatia and said that he thought &#39;dear to us even God can not help&#39;. Hebrang for the HDZ club said that the opposition has chosen the wrong moment for a debate on a vote of confidence because the &quot;government is in full swing.&quot; With that disagreed Stazić who said that this is the last moment and has lost the confidence of the people. &#39;And how would you here in parliament defending the man who publicly, here in Parliament admitted that he lied, defending a man who has gone down as prime minister, Ivo Sanader, &quot;said Stazić.
 &gt;&gt; VIDEO: &#39;Stazić lie to me lie that the PM lied&#39;&gt;&gt; &#39;hard that I voted against the majority &quot;seems to me that the average voter in this debate misses through your head cry&#39; My God, why hast thou forsaken me &#39;, said Pupovac &#39;Stazić lie to me lie that the PM lied. Corrects what I said I did. I said that I think the PM went because I said, I think and I have a right to think of 90 year, as much as you like it, sir Stazić not like it, &quot;said Hebrang. Club representative SDSS Milorad Pupovac tried to follow the discussion from another pesrpektive. &#39;At the moment I tried to be in the position of the average voter who looks at us and maybe I&#39;ll presmjelo conclusions, but it seems to me that the average voter has passed through my head cry&#39; My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me &#39;. Dinko Buric on behalf HDSSB announced he would vote no confidence for Prime Minister. Government criticized for treading the value of the war, the introduction of Croatian in debt bondage to the brink of economic collapse, unscrupulous looting and maćehinski attitude towards Slavonia.
 &#39;The time has come for the fulfillment of prophetic words of Prime Minister&#39; Kud &#39;Ivo tud&#39; I &#39;, &quot;said Buric. Raprava be sharpened when the Zoran Milanovic during exposure HDZ member Boris Kunst said, &#39;you fool&#39;. He then sought the intervention Milanovic Friscic as chairman and repeatedly mentioned as the MPs swear. &#39;False is that someone has cursed. A colleague called him a fool, and it&#39;s not blasphemy, &quot;said Matusic. Is inaccurate and false libel that the HDZ leadership criminal organization and therefore should consider the application of Article 129 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia on the activities of political parties. Top SDP destroy the fundamental principles of constitutional order, does not recognize the decision of the Constitutional Court and therefore could be very much under the impact of legislation and ban political parties SDP Vladimir Seks &#39;and Obama today was a good witness of Prime Minister&#39; Dragutin Lesar after exposure Secretary HDZ Bacic said that surpassed Minister Milinovic that some day in Gospic, said that the HDZ, HSS, HSP, independent representatives, England and America support the president of SDP.
 &#39;In this discussion you are pulled and the European People&#39;s Party. I do not know whether you are answering them for the work of the Croatian Parliament, but I do not. If I am not mistaken, this is the same party that was until a year ago saying that Croatia&#39;s EU can only import Ivo Sanader and nobody else. We heard today that the good work of the Government witnesses were Obama, Barrosso and everyone else, &quot;said Lesar. &#39;Are you a criminal organization? &quot; Vladimir Seks looked at Romane comment Agents Jerković that his exposure to &#39;truly the twilight of democracy and parliamentarism. &quot; &#39;Indeed it was an exciting and serious exposure Agents Jerkovic. A presentation was the twilight of democracy because I bare ruling SDP and its satellites, &quot;Seks said. &#39;Starting confidence in the Government only in form, such a requirement, and its content in a single indictment and verdict politikanskoj with all the features of a mounted political process, &quot;Seks said, adding that a bare lie on the inter-party conflicts and the big lie, which is Zeljko Jovanovic said again, that the HDZ leadership and criminal organizations.
 &#39;Are you going to make a small inversion, so that in your write statements that the top SDP-a criminal organization, gang, criminal organization? Will you agree to be a criminal organization? Did you like it or not? &quot;Seks said. &#39;SDP does not want to participate in this disgrace&#39; after 20-minute break, Zoran Milanovic addressed Parliament and quoted a statement by Vladimir Seks, which says that we should consider a ban on the SDP. &#39;SDP in this disgrace will no longer participate, and you want to, &quot;Milanovic said. Hebrang as Chairman of the HDZ was invited to be tolerant to continue the discussion and said it could be found even worse than this sexy statement when viewing the hearing transcript. I am not invoking the prohibition of the SDP, I was referring to the constitutional provision of Article 109 Constitution, and I said in the context when I challenged the inaccurate claims Jovanovic and Milanovic, the HDZ leadership criminal organization, and I found that the top SDP-a criminal organization and that threatens the foundations of constitutional order and fundamental constitutional principles, &quot;said Seks.
 Agent Damian Cain said that some lawmakers exaggerated. Seks&#39;, referring to the statement commented that it is not good, but the opposition has said it can not actually run through the night for the better. Friscic the Prime Minister has given support (Photo: Reuters)
