Even 26.1 percent fewer dwellings was completed last year in Croatia compared to 2008. year, according to data from the Central Bureau of Statistics. And as in 2008. 25 368 dwellings were completed, their numbers fell last year for 6628, to 18 740. In Croatia in 2009. 8434 completed the building, which is 15 percent (1489 building) is less than the previous year. This year, the entire housing and construction sector, which is considered the engine of the economy, continued to fall even more dramatically. Imbalance markets - From January to June 2010. construction companies with 20 or more employees ended in 1900 dwellings, which is 54.2 percent less than the same period 2009th year - said Rudolf Rom, director of construction and municipal economy in the Croatian Chamber of Commerce. These data show the best in what is a crisis of housing and construction sector in Croatia. Number of new dwellings has fallen dramatically primarily because only in Zagreb, it is estimated, more than 10,000 unsold new flats.
 The question is whether the decline in housing construction also affect the decline in housing prices in this and next year. - Decline of construction means that the construction industry is slowly falling into increasing liquidity problems due to the reduction of construction, and ultimately will be a large part of them, unfortunately, have to file for bankruptcy because it will not be financially strong enough to welcome the sale of accumulated housing. Decline will continue as long as not being serious falling housing prices. The only way to balance the market&#39;s price declines, and subsequent fall in investment in construction. When you sell stocks of unsold apartments, will begin a new cycle of investments - said Josip Tica, a professor with the Faculty of Economics and an expert on real estate sector. The average price of € 1818 Prices of apartments in Croatia, is constantly falling, but it is enough to start selling. Average property prices demanded in Croatia in September compared to August low of 1.2 percent, while year on year, compared to September 2009., 5.3 percent lower, according to data from the portal CentarNekretnina.
 The average housing price demanded was in Zagreb in September 1818 a euro per square meter, which is 0.9 percent less than in the previous month and 4.7 percent lower than in September 2009. Real estate prices in some neighborhoods in Zagreb is currently already below 20 to 30 percent compared to the price which was achieved in 2008. Thus, at Laniste, in Spanish, Dubrava, Sesvetama Trešnjevke and parts prices in the past two years corrected with levels from 1600 to 2000 euros per square meter in 1200 to 1600 euros. Pad housing is disastrous effect on the employment in construction and associated sectors. - Number of employees in construction decreased in the first six months of this year to 89 986. In the past 18 months in jobs lost 18 300 jobs, about a thousand a month. Let it be known that, together with craftsmen were employed in jobs almost 150 000 employees, while supporting the industry of building materials, then the timber industry, transport and trade is approximately 50,000.
 As the situation is the same or very similar in construction companies, craftsmen and related sectors, is assumed to be lost almost 36,000 jobs, or 18 percent of the total - said Rom. Invest in smaller projects in order to overcome a disastrous trend in construction is necessary, according to Rom, run the investing public and the private sector and boost exports of construction projects. - Public sector must provide the funds for investment in projects, but at the same time have a lower priority projects faster return invested funds, to emphasize the rapid development of the economy and employment. The private sector should be facilitated to ensure the conditions of obtaining the loan, less interest and greater job security, a guaranteed amount of interest on loans and other benefits - said Rudolf Rom.
