Erduan Katana day before the election campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the slogans of political parties it is clear that this campaign and send more messages facing the past than the future. Only on the basis of the slogans of political parties by voters, it would hardly be able to understand how and in what manner they think politicians to solve their problems if they come to power. On the basis of slogans largest political parties in BiH, but it is now clear that even for this general election will not move away from promoting national awareness of voters. The two main blocks in the RS SNSD-led and SDS suprotstaviće the message &quot;Serbian forever&quot; and &quot;Together for the Serbian.&quot; Executive secretary of SNSD Rajko Vasic said that the choice of a slogan for this year&#39;s general elections only a logical sequence of political parties since 2006. year: The SNSD said that their slogan this year&#39;s only logical consequence of the political party since 2006.
 year. &quot;Because we are before the 2006th &#39;The Future of Serbian&#39; slogan, so we had 2006th &#39;Winning Serbian forward&#39;, we have had for early presidential elections&#39; first Serbian Republic &#39;, in local Serbian elections in my house&#39;, then it is a policy that we mapped in our program, &quot;said Vasic. Democratic Action Party and Party for BiH will try to attract voters of his messages, &quot;people know&quot; and &quot;Country first and foremost.&quot; &quot;People really need to know who is the most radio and whose priority is the people versus the state and of personal and individual interest, under one. Under the two SDA&#39;s National Party and member of the European people&#39;s party. Under three, people need to be reminded of all those reasons and the fact that the SDA has done for BiH &quot;, says Secretary General Amir Zukic SDA. Slogan SDP BiH State for a man &quot;, according to leaders of this party Zlatko Lagumdzija, reflecting their five key policies. Part of the campaign the SDP and the &#39;song selection&#39; &quot;The five policy - job for a man, a man of justice, social justice for a man, a man of education, health care for the man, actually collects together in one word, and it is State of the man, &quot;said Lagumdzija.
 Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian slogans in the slogan of the parties that are facing Croatian electorate is dominated by the word &quot;power&quot;. For voters to decide between &quot;the forces that believe&quot;, HDZ BiH, and the &quot;forces of unity, gathered around the HDZ-a 1990. President HDZ-a 1990 Ljubic: With software conventions Croatian coalition HDZ1990 - HSP BiH held on 10 July, 2010 Mostar, &quot;As a party, we opted for the slogan&quot; For my people, for my country. &quot; He is very komplermentaran with the slogan on our presidential candidate, Martin Raguz &#39;This is our country&#39;. On the other hand, we were playing for the elections in coalition with the Croatian Party of Rights and our common motto is &#39;Strength of unity&#39;, because in a true collaboration with our political partners, with the possible post-partners, primarily counting on the HSS-NHI and to all others that support this policy we truly in a union we want to work to achieve equality of Croatian and BiH a functional state, &quot;said Ljubic.
 Biljana Bogdanić, an expert in political marketing, believes that even this year&#39;s election campaign does not bring anything new when it comes to slogans of political parties. &quot;Instead of being divided into slogans, images, slogans on themes or slogans calling for specific political parties, we are, like everything else in Bosnia, can be divided into Bosnian, Croatian or Serbian slogans. Thus, political parties continue to play on the national ticket, a political slogan looks more like a recycled material from post-war period, &quot;says Bogdanić. Way to communicate the major parties in BiH with a lot of voters behind the environment, opinion is a professor of public opinion in Banja Luka, Mladen Mirosavljević. Slogans are usually boils down to is in them still call the state or entity, nation, or some of their interests, behind which is supposedly determined by the party, says a professor of public opinion Mladen Mirosavljević.
 &quot;Far behind the Croatian, and even Montenegro, not to mention that Slovenia is in everything that moved so far. We can notice a lack of imagination, inventiveness neodostaje in general, especially to come up with some slogans that would be receptive to people, that would be memorable and that people would link. Basically some slogans to devise a way to always call them to the state or entity, nation, or some of their interests beyond which apparently is determined by the party, &quot;says Milosavljevic. If you look at the slogan of political parties that dominate the political scene in Bosnia during the nineties of the last century, it will be seen that they are not much changed. Previously, the SDA has used the slogan &quot;In my country and my faith,&quot; and the Party for BiH telling &quot;It is time for BiH without entities&quot;. For the grouping of voters in the 2000 elections. The SDS has used the slogan &quot;Serbian Glasajmo&quot; and HDZ BiH orientation or extinction. &quot;
