Have positively impacted on the market yesterday retailers Wal-Mart and Home Depot because they reported better than expected operating results in the second quarter. Home Depot shares Poskupila was 3.4, a Wal-Mart, 1.2 percent. Most of the more than 27 percent, the share price jumped Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, after the mining giant BHP Billiton has offered 39 billion dollars for the download of the world&#39;s largest fertilizer producer.
 However, Potash rejected the offer as inadequate. Although yesterday the market was more optimistic than in previous days, analysts say it is too early to talk about recovery from the recent market fall, when the Dow Jones in four days has lost almost 400 points. The traffic is, say, skinny, and many investors are still on vacation or are wary of vague macroeconomic data. And the European stock markets stock prices rose yesterday.
