Ties between Turkey and the United States and the convergence between Turkey and Armenia will suffer if the U.S. Congress passed a resolution that would recognize the Armenian genocide committed during the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, warned on Monday the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Warning comes from the time the Foreign Affairs Committee U.S. House of Representatives will be on Thursday to discuss a resolution on the massacre of between half and 1.5 million Armenians since 1915. to 1917. year. &quot;We expect the committee to reject the mentioned draft resolution that will harm Turkish-American ties and cause a termination of efforts to normalize ties between Turkey and Armenia,&quot; the ministry said in a statement. &quot;We believe that the board members aware of the damage that will cause their draft resolution efforts for peace and stability in South Caucasus and will therefore act responsibly,&quot; it added in the text. The issue of the Armenian genocide is a diplomatic minefield.
