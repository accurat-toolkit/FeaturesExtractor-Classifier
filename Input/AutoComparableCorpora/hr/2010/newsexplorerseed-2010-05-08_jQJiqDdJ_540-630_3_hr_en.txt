Sitting in front of the room a personal computer thinking about how much the United Kingdom as a country to change after this year, Thursday 05/06/2010. What will be the election result reflects the region where you live? What consequences will this have for Croatia and what will happen if the Conservatives win the first time after 13 years of Labour in power? As time passes, the race for the votes of all the uncertain and unpredictable. Until two days ago I thought that conservatives will overwhelmingly win more votes, but still present a concern for so-called. &#39;&#39;Hung Parliament&#39;&#39;. Hanging Parliament is happening in a situation where a party does not win the overwhelming advantage after the general election, which means 326 or more members of the 650th overall Last time the British Parliament so experienced something back in 1974th year, when Labour with 301 representative, won 4 seats more than the Conservatives but also won and 250,000 votes or less.
 One of the reasons the current situation was the recklessness of the current Prime Minister Gordon Brown in a recent interview with Gillian Duffy, an old woman of 66 years that Brown was directly in front of cameras posing the question relating to emigration from Eastern Europe. Here is my translation of the original transcript between Brown and Duffy: Duffy: I can not say anything against immigrants because you say, you&#39;re ... - but all these eastern Europeans are coming, how to accumulate so much? Brown: One million people came from Europe but it is a million Britons went to Europe, you probably know that there are many people in the UK now living in Europe. So education, health care and how to help people, it is precisely that which I do myself. Brown is just a little later, when he did not know the microphone is not muted said this:&#39;&#39;It (Gillian Duffy) is just the kind of intolerant woman who says he voted for Labour.
 Absurd!&#39;&#39;The word that is used (ie&#39;&#39;bigot&#39;&#39;) in the Croatian language or many translations and interpreting it wrong. I&#39;ve seen so Vecernji journalist and Slobodna Dalmacija journalist used the word&#39;&#39;fanatical&#39;&#39;. No such choice of words is lost and the whole purpose of articles or topics on which a person and spoke. Topic of immigration and immigrants in Britain with the economic situation is one of the most pressing issue in this election. Of course it is extensively used by themselves conservatives. While on the one hand and a sign of good news is that Cameron curb.
 * Immigration in the UK and that is the difference between immigration from EU countries on the one hand and Africa and Asia on the other side, of course, is bad news in a way that immigration will be restricted to persons coming from countries that will join in the future EU. This of course applies to Croatia, but I personally do not worry because, as an average Croatian goal of life anyway should not be emigration to Britain. On the other hand, in a potential cabinet Cameron might be able to find a person like Pauline Neville Jones. Although never a member torijevske shadow government, but only in the immediate vicinity of David Cameron, it affects the formation of his own attitudes toward foreign policy (while we think about foreign policy outside the EU). Her personal ambition is to be the secretary for external security, a majority of seats, Douglas Hurd spent as his deputy (Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs), which is a duty that is Malcolm Rifkind after Hurd retirement abolished.
 Paulina together with Hurd moved to the board of NatWest Bank where Hurd was appointed as the advisor for political affairs, and Paulina his assistant. During their brief period in the NatWest, the bank has entered into an agreement with Slobodan Milosevic for consultancy services in privatization of the former Serbian PTT. Both were subsequently had to resign after the media (Guardian) announced doubt that the conclusion of contracts received millions in fees from the account of the Cyprus branch Beobanka - which nominally was not a party to the privatization of PTT. Formed a parliamentary committee that several years later (after Milosevic had already been demolished with the government) finds that in these transactions, there was nothing inappropriate. It remains therefore to see how and in what way the British policy towards the Croatian change in the future, largely because Cameron to shift from a policy that was once led by Baroness Thatcher as leader of the Conservative Party.
 Cameron have also been objected to and that relies on the so-called. network&#39;&#39;old boys&#39;&#39;while referring to the people who have completed the expensive schools and universities and were members of various associations on their studies and did the elite, and has been under attack because of his party made a short list of selected candidates for possible in parliament. Cameron&#39;s family was connected with the Rothschild family by working together with them in the financial negotiations, and he said he worships &quot;elite arrogant&#39;&#39;approach to teaching that is reflected in the controversial plans by the Conservative Party has for education. One of the items of these plans was and criticized recently when the father of a boy who has cerebral palsy, Jonathan Bardley spoke with Cameron on the streets of eliminating differences that are set for children with health problems when they want to include in the standard educational structure. will change some settings in relation to Great Britain and Northern Ireland Labour, which has greatly criticized.
 The Conservatives will also srezivanjem contributions for the public sector (mainly accumulated bureaucracy in this case) to put itself to the goal that could lead to a balance between the private sector, that trade and private firms on one side and public sectors which belong to the civil service on the other side. Cuts will also be in the northeast of England, which will probably meet the same fate as Northern Ireland. Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg have achieved a drastic rise in its popularity thanks to television debates on TV stations, the last one on the BBC aired last Thursday and which was first won by David Cameron. In the previous three debates winners were Nick Clegg. Delighted the public of their combined experience and ingenuity that has the Euro as a lawmaker and a representative option that Britain will be Europe, which is quite the opposite of what David Cameron is thinking about the UK and its role in the European Community.
 Thus, in his article of 2002&#39;&#39;Do not mention the war. Grow up&#39;&#39;which he wrote for the British Guardian Clegg criticized but ironically entrenched negative British attitude and stance towards the Germans and the Second World War. In the article he writes,&#39;&#39;that even those people from Britain who is always close your eyes to the prosperity of German towns and cities, schools, hospitals and transport systems, when you visit Germany can not possibly pretend that the quality of British life in general comparable with the German standards&#39;&#39;. Personally I think it&#39;s all said. Therefore, it and some media in Britain attacked the incurring ridicule&#39;&#39;tradition&#39;&#39;of Great Britain. In the article about how no one is talking like this and you yourself can read it anyway. (Http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/19/eu.germany) Although I disagree with the politics of liberal democracy *** I personally and for Liberal option can sympathize Nick Clegg as the educated man who speaks as many as 5 different languages, lived outside the UK, and his view on Europe is far more progressive than what it offers Eurosceptic David Cameron as well as one who holds the Gordon Brown.
 Clegg also warned Cameron not to be complacent about possible to secure the victory of conservatives in the general election. Told him thus:&#39;&#39;In this country the power authority does not inherit - should they deserve&#39;&#39;. How this all applies to Croatia as a country that wants to join as a member of the European Union? Whatever the outcome of the election was a matter which the parties claimed victory in general elections in Britain, it is important for Croatia to be oriented primarily to itself and not other people&#39;s interests and different spheres of interest. Recently I again scroll through some books that I keep in my home library. If you carefully read and study, we can find that thread that connects, but slowly forgotten thinkers of the Croatian Ivo Pilar and Dr. Milan pl. Šufflaya, Baron Sarkotić to prof. Orsanici and Dr. Korskoga, and that is that we can not return to the Balkans. As to the article&#39;&#39;The Voice&#39;&#39;Dr. Croatian blood
 Milan pl. Sufflay writes,&#39;&#39;the nation of Croatia is a place in the west and the west. Croatian nation has no place in the Balkans. Who is linked against the West, working against the Croatian history. Who is going in the Balkans, the Croatian blood poisoning.&#39;&#39;But of course the notion that the West alleges that Dr. Sufflay does not mean rushing heedlessly into something for which we are willing as a people and country. West, geographically we belong and should not be in that absolutely never more to prove to anyone. So the professor. Oršanić says:&#39;&#39;Every man and every nation must determine for themselves and choose their basic framework of opportunism or condition of life of radicalism. Thus, opportunism has become the ideology of personal success in all possible categories of desires, pleasures, goals, opportunities and possibilities, a radical ideology ideological success, in terms of struggle, sacrifice, sacrifice and idealism.&#39;&#39;Post modern radical traditionalist would also prefer to sit on a mountain bike and whisk in nature, take the family on a trip or hiking together, enjoy nature, spend time with your children, your spouse or read an interesting book from which to learn.
 A opportunists? So I guess I should not write about it. It is enough to turn on a television set or open a daily newspaper and see a grotesque and distorted face of a series of plastic surgeries that are offered as an exemplary role model or a model which must be followed.

 The correct term for the English word&#39;&#39;Bigoted&#39;&#39;in Croatian interpretation would be: Intolerant / or the intolerant / According to another race, nation, religion or gender.
