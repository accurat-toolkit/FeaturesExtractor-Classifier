Wikileaks, a Web site belonging to the family Wiki, caught in April this year, by no means neglectable media attention, when on the internet revealed a shocking video of U.S. military action in Iraq from the year 2007., In which the Apache helicopters on Baghdad&#39;s streets was shot nine unarmed people , including two Reuters journalists, Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh, and two children were wounded. The media picked up the chase, particularly around the mysterious Australian hackers Julien Assangea, the nominal founder of Wikileaks, which is appropriate&#39;&#39;disappeared&#39;&#39;somewhere in Reykjavik in Iceland, creating the impression as if the American intelligence&#39;&#39;seek&#39;&#39;, but he escapes and almost is&#39;&#39;in hiding&#39;&#39;in Sweden and surrounding countries. The story has come even to the point that his life could be in danger. Assange became not only the elusive celebrity, but also a major promoter of global freedom of speech, press, and&#39;&#39;the right to information&#39;&#39;.
 In the meantime, because of leaks in June, he was arrested 22-year-old Bradley Manning, intelligence analyst at the U.S. military, which is supposedly in the online chat with widely in California hacker Adrian Lama admitted that he had forwarded the video to Wikileaks. In addition, it was announced and that the Manning delivered Assangeu and an enormous amount of intelligence and diplomatic telegrams and dispatches from the State Department&#39;s Middle East, under the label&#39;&#39;confidential&#39;&#39;. Everywhere is spinning with the sentences, chat in the FBI report I Lamo, where Manning says&#39;&#39;de Hilary Clinton get a heart attack when you wake up one morning and see the manifestation of&#39;&#39;telegrams. After the summer break, the famous telegram appeared a few days ago on page WiliLeaks, since the Ministry of Defense once politely asked neulovljivog Assangea through the media for not reporting stolen goods. But while on one hand celebrates the victory of&#39;&#39;press freedom&#39;&#39;and daring group of activists that, despite the reluctance establishment choices for the free flow or leakage of information, an American political analyst Webster G.
 Tarpley has a different opinion about it. In an article that talks about the direct signals of the war that almost broke out in the Middle East, on the role of Wikileaks in preparing a war of public opinion says this:&#39;&#39;Against the background of colorful screen war confusing the alarm, a group of agents-provocateurs who call themselves Wikileaks found is it necessary to publish the entire stock of documents, more than 90 000 worthless American telegram from Afghanistan in low or no degree of confidentiality. These items do not contain anything controversial or against Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell, Obama, Biden, Gates, even against a single official from the top. Instead, these documents provide support to theories that the CIA&#39;s Osama bin Laden,&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;a real person, and Modan enemy of the United States-which is obvious nonsense. Remembered also that the Assange said the re-raise the official version of 11 / 9 2,001th baloney.
 Assangeove actions are obviously inspired by a combination of George Soros, Cass Sunstein and Samantha Power of Obama&#39;s National Security Council. For now it is quite a mental note that the strategic map that emerges from hrpetine Wikileaks document reflects the intentions of some of the most dangerous currents in the intelligence community, the United States. Interpretation and hrpetine documents, which were appropriately rastrubljena through the news organ of the ruling class, like the New York Times, London Guardian, and the German Der Spiegel, emphasize very nice that the Afghan war fruitless, while the real enemies of the United States and the Western world are traitors in Pakistan the backstabbing, supporting the Taliban and killing American soldiers, then they are of course the Iranians, who make every effort to make clear the U.S. presence in areas of western Afghanistan near its borders. In short, whoever created an imperialistic policy based on lessons from hrpetine Wikileaks documents, will soon meet with Devinovim plan, or with harsh measures in order to Pakistan and to Iran.
 This very pampered hrpetina documents, which was lavishly popularized by the media controlled world, is revealed as a CIA-control operations in the tradition of thought and Daniela Elsberga pentagonskih documents from the 1971st year, which is similar to that presentation was controlled by a disinformation fatamorganske groups, designed to manipulate public opinion. Boris&#39;&#39;Kolak / HRsvijet Apparently Wikileaks is an introduction to limit and control the last free medium: the Internet!
