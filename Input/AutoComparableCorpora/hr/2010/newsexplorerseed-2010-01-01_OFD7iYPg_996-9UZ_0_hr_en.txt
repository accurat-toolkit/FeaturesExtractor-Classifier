&quot;So far we have not got any opportunity to present our case,&quot; Bhardwaj said commenting on the interim bail given by a local sessions court hearing the case after two fresh FIRS were registered against the former DGP. Bharadwaj said he will oppose Rathore&#39;s bail at the next date. &quot;We are hopeful of getting justice,&quot; he said, describing the interim bail as part of the profession. Asked whether the development was a setback to the case against Rathore, Bhardwaj expressed the hope that they will &quot;expose the truth&quot; at the next date on January 7th &quot;So far we have not got any opportunity to present our case,&quot; he said. On whether they would approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court to get the interim bail canceled, he said, &quot;There is no question of going to the High Court at this stage.&quot; He charged Abha, the wife and Rathore with counsel of misleading the court on various facts, including the existence of as Veena Subhash chander Girhotra&#39;s wife.
 Bhardwaj said they hoped the Panckula Police would soon register the third FIR against Rathore on the complaint filed by Ruchika&#39;s brother Ashu yesterday under section 307 IPC (attempt to murder).
